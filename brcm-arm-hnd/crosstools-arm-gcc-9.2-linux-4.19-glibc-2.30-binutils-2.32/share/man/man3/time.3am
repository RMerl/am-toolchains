.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.I time
extension adds two functions named
.B gettimeofday()
and
.BR sleep() ,
as follows.
.TP
.B gettimeofday()
This function returns the number of seconds since the Epoch
as a floating-point value. It should have subsecond precision.
It returns \-1 upon error and sets
.B ERRNO
to indicate the problem.
.TP
.BI sleep( seconds )
This function attempts to sleep for the given amount of seconds, which
may include a fractional portion.
If
.I seconds
is negative, or the attempt to sleep fails,
then it returns \-1 and sets
.BR ERRNO .
Otherwise, the function should return 0 after sleeping
for the indicated amount of time.
