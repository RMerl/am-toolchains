.SH NAME
inplace \- emulate sed/perl/ruby in-place editing
.SH SYNOPSIS
.ft CW
.nf
gawk -i inplace ...
.fi
.ft R
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.I inplace
extension adds two functions named
.B inplace_begin()
and
.BR inplace_end() .
These functions are meant to be invoked from the
.I inplace.awk
wrapper which is installed when
.I gawk
is.
.PP
By default, each named file on the command line is
replaced with a new file of the same name whose contents
are the results of running the AWK program.
If the user supplies an AWK variable named
.B INPLACE_SUFFIX
in a
.B BEGIN
rule or on the command line, then the
.I inplace
extension concatenates that suffix onto the original
filename and uses the result as a filename for renaming
the original.
.PP
One can disable inplace editing selectively by placing
.B inplace=0
on the command line prior to files that should be processed normally.
One can reenable inplace editing by placing
.B inplace=1
prior to files that should be subject to inplace editing.
.\" .SH NOTES
.SH BUGS
While the extension does attempt to preserve ownership and permissions, it makes no attempt to copy the ACLs from the original file.
.PP
If the program dies prematurely, as might happen if an unhandled signal is received, a temporary file may be left behind.
