.SH NAME
readdir \- directory input parser for gawk
.SH SYNOPSIS
.ft CW
@load "readdir"
.ft R
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.I readdir
extension
adds an input parser for directories.
.PP
When this extension is in use, instead of skipping directories named
on the command line (or with
.BR getline ),
they are read, with each entry returned as a record.
.PP
The record consists of three fields. The first two are the inode number and the
filename, separated by a forward slash character.
On systems where the directory entry contains the file type, the record
has a third field which is a single letter indicating the type of the
file:
.B f
for file,
.B d
for directory,
.B b
for a block device,
.B c
for a character device,
.B p
for a FIFO,
.B l
for a symbolic link,
.B s
for a socket.
.PP
On systems without the file type information, the extension falls back
to calling
.IR stat (2),
in order to provide the information.
Thus the third field should never be
.BR u .
