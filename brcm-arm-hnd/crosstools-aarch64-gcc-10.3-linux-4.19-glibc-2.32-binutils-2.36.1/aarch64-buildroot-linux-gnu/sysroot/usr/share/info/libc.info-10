35.2.2.3 Functions for Waiting According to a Specific Clock
............................................................

The GNU C Library provides several waiting functions that expect an
explicit `clockid_t' argument.

 -- Function: int sem_clockwait (sem_t *SEM, clockid_t CLOCKID,
     const struct timespec *ABSTIME) Behaves like `sem_timedwait'
     except the time ABSTIME is measured against the clock specified by
     CLOCKID rather than `CLOCK_REALTIME'.  Currently, CLOCKID must be
     either `CLOCK_MONOTONIC' or `CLOCK_REALTIME'.

 -- Function: int pthread_cond_clockwait (pthread_cond_t *COND,
          pthread_mutex_t *MUTEX,
     clockid_t CLOCKID, const struct timespec *ABSTIME) Preliminary: |
     MT-Safe | AS-Unsafe lock | AC-Unsafe lock | *Note POSIX Safety
     Concepts::.

     Behaves like `pthread_cond_timedwait' except the time ABSTIME is
     measured against the clock specified by CLOCKID rather than the
     clock specified or defaulted when `pthread_cond_init' was called.
     Currently, CLOCKID must be either `CLOCK_MONOTONIC' or
     `CLOCK_REALTIME'.

 -- Function: int pthread_rwlock_clockrdlock (pthread_rwlock_t *RWLOCK,
     				       clockid_t CLOCKID,
           const struct timespec *ABSTIME)

     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Unsafe lock | AC-Unsafe lock | *Note
     POSIX Safety Concepts::.

     Behaves like `pthread_rwlock_timedrdlock' except the time ABSTIME
     is measured against the clock specified by CLOCKID rather than
     `CLOCK_REALTIME'.  Currently, CLOCKID must be either
     `CLOCK_MONOTONIC' or `CLOCK_REALTIME', otherwise `EINVAL' is
     returned.

 -- Function: int pthread_rwlock_clockwrlock (pthread_rwlock_t *RWLOCK,
     				       clockid_t CLOCKID,
           const struct timespec *ABSTIME)

     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Unsafe lock | AC-Unsafe lock | *Note
     POSIX Safety Concepts::.

     Behaves like `pthread_rwlock_timedwrlock' except the time ABSTIME
     is measured against the clock specified by CLOCKID rather than
     `CLOCK_REALTIME'.  Currently, CLOCKID must be either
     `CLOCK_MONOTONIC' or `CLOCK_REALTIME', otherwise `EINVAL' is
     returned.

 -- Function: int pthread_tryjoin_np (pthread_t *THREAD,
     				      void **THREAD_RETURN)

     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Unsafe lock | AC-Unsafe lock | *Note
     POSIX Safety Concepts::.

     Behaves like `pthread_join' except that it will return `EBUSY'
     immediately if the thread specified by THREAD has not yet
     terminated.

 -- Function: int pthread_timedjoin_np (pthread_t *THREAD,
     				      void **THREAD_RETURN,
          const struct timespec *ABSTIME)

     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Unsafe lock | AC-Unsafe lock | *Note
     POSIX Safety Concepts::.

     Behaves like `pthread_tryjoin_np' except that it will block until
     the absolute time ABSTIME measured against `CLOCK_REALTIME' is
     reached if the thread has not terminated by that time and return
     `EBUSY'. If ABSTIME is equal to `NULL' then the function will wait
     forever in the same way as `pthread_join'.

 -- Function: int pthread_clockjoin_np (pthread_t *THREAD,
     				      void **THREAD_RETURN,
                              clockid_t CLOCKID,
          const struct timespec *ABSTIME)

     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Unsafe lock | AC-Unsafe lock | *Note
     POSIX Safety Concepts::.

     Behaves like `pthread_timedjoin_np' except that the absolute time
     in ABSTIME is measured against the clock specified by CLOCKID.


File: libc.info,  Node: Single-Threaded,  Prev: Waiting with Explicit Clocks,  Up: Non-POSIX Extensions

35.2.2.4 Detecting Single-Threaded Execution
............................................

Multi-threaded programs require synchronization among threads.  This
synchronization can be costly even if there is just a single thread and
no data is shared between multiple processors.  The GNU C Library offers
an interface to detect whether the process is in single-threaded mode.
Applications can use this information to avoid synchronization, for
example by using regular instructions to load and store memory instead
of atomic instructions, or using relaxed memory ordering instead of
stronger memory ordering.

 -- Variable: char __libc_single_threaded
     This variable is non-zero if the current process is definitely
     single-threaded.  If it is zero, the process may be multi-threaded,
     or the GNU C Library cannot determine at this point of the program
     execution whether the process is single-threaded or not.

     Applications must never write to this variable.

   Most applications should perform the same actions whether or not
`__libc_single_threaded' is true, except with less synchronization.  If
this rule is followed, a process that subsequently becomes
multi-threaded is already in a consistent state.  For example, in order
to increment a reference count, the following code can be used:

     if (__libc_single_threaded)
       atomic_fetch_add (&reference_count, 1, memory_order_relaxed);
     else
       atomic_fetch_add (&reference_count, 1, memory_order_acq_rel);

   This still requires some form of synchronization on the
single-threaded branch, so it can be beneficial not to declare the
reference count as `_Atomic', and use the GCC `__atomic' built-ins.
*Note Built-in Functions for Memory Model Aware Atomic Operations:
(gcc)__atomic Builtins.  Then the code to increment a reference count
looks like this:

     if (__libc_single_threaded)
       ++refeference_count;
     else
       __atomic_fetch_add (&reference_count, 1, __ATOMIC_ACQ_REL);

   (Depending on the data associated with the reference count, it may be
possible to use the weaker `__ATOMIC_RELAXED' memory ordering on the
multi-threaded branch.)

   Several functions in the GNU C Library can change the value of the
`__libc_single_threaded' variable.  For example, creating new threads
using the `pthread_create' or `thrd_create' function sets the variable
to false.  This can also happen indirectly, say via a call to `dlopen'.
Therefore, applications need to make a copy of the value of
`__libc_single_threaded' if after such a function call, behavior must
match the value as it was before the call, like this:

     bool single_threaded = __libc_single_threaded;
     if (single_threaded)
       prepare_single_threaded ();
     else
       prepare_multi_thread ();

     void *handle = dlopen (shared_library_name, RTLD_NOW);
     lookup_symbols (handle);

     if (single_threaded)
       cleanup_single_threaded ();
     else
       cleanup_multi_thread ();

   Since the value of `__libc_single_threaded' can change from true to
false during the execution of the program, it is not useful for
selecting optimized function implementations in IFUNC resolvers.

   Atomic operations can also be used on mappings shared among
single-threaded processes.  This means that a compiler must not use
`__libc_single_threaded' to optimize atomic operations, unless it is
able to prove that the memory is not shared.

   *Implementation Note:* The `__libc_single_threaded' variable is not
declared as `volatile' because it is expected that compilers optimize a
sequence of single-threaded checks into one check, for example if
several reference counts are updated.  The current implementation in
the GNU C Library does not set the `__libc_single_threaded' variable to
a true value if a process turns single-threaded again.  Future versions
of the GNU C Library may do this, but only as the result of function
calls which imply an acquire (compiler) barrier.  (Some compilers
assume that well-known functions such as `malloc' do not write to
global variables, and setting `__libc_single_threaded' would introduce
a data race and undefined behavior.)  In any case, an application must
not write to `__libc_single_threaded' even if it has joined the last
application-created thread because future versions of the GNU C Library
may create background threads after the first thread has been created,
and the application has no way of knowning that these threads are
present.

36 Internal probes
******************

In order to aid in debugging and monitoring internal behavior, the GNU
C Library exposes nearly-zero-overhead SystemTap probes marked with the
`libc' provider.

   These probes are not part of the GNU C Library stable ABI, and they
are subject to change or removal across releases.  Our only promise with
regard to them is that, if we find a need to remove or modify the
arguments of a probe, the modified probe will have a different name, so
that program monitors relying on the old probe will not get unexpected
arguments.

36.1 Memory Allocation Probes
=============================

These probes are designed to signal relatively unusual situations within
the virtual memory subsystem of the GNU C Library.

 -- Probe: memory_sbrk_more (void *$ARG1, size_t $ARG2)
     This probe is triggered after the main arena is extended by calling
     `sbrk'.  Argument $ARG1 is the additional size requested to
     `sbrk', and $ARG2 is the pointer that marks the end of the `sbrk'
     area, returned in response to the request.

 -- Probe: memory_sbrk_less (void *$ARG1, size_t $ARG2)
     This probe is triggered after the size of the main arena is
     decreased by calling `sbrk'.  Argument $ARG1 is the size released
     by `sbrk' (the positive value, rather than the negative value
     passed to `sbrk'), and $ARG2 is the pointer that marks the end of
     the `sbrk' area, returned in response to the request.

 -- Probe: memory_heap_new (void *$ARG1, size_t $ARG2)
     This probe is triggered after a new heap is `mmap'ed.  Argument
     $ARG1 is a pointer to the base of the memory area, where the
     `heap_info' data structure is held, and $ARG2 is the size of the
     heap.

 -- Probe: memory_heap_free (void *$ARG1, size_t $ARG2)
     This probe is triggered _before_ (unlike the other sbrk and heap
     probes) a heap is completely removed via `munmap'.  Argument $ARG1
     is a pointer to the heap, and $ARG2 is the size of the heap.

 -- Probe: memory_heap_more (void *$ARG1, size_t $ARG2)
     This probe is triggered after a trailing portion of an `mmap'ed
     heap is extended.  Argument $ARG1 is a pointer to the heap, and
     $ARG2 is the new size of the heap.

 -- Probe: memory_heap_less (void *$ARG1, size_t $ARG2)
     This probe is triggered after a trailing portion of an `mmap'ed
     heap is released.  Argument $ARG1 is a pointer to the heap, and
     $ARG2 is the new size of the heap.

 -- Probe: memory_malloc_retry (size_t $ARG1)
 -- Probe: memory_realloc_retry (size_t $ARG1, void *$ARG2)
 -- Probe: memory_memalign_retry (size_t $ARG1, size_t $ARG2)
 -- Probe: memory_calloc_retry (size_t $ARG1)
     These probes are triggered when the corresponding functions fail to
     obtain the requested amount of memory from the arena in use,
     before they call `arena_get_retry' to select an alternate arena in
     which to retry the allocation.  Argument $ARG1 is the amount of
     memory requested by the user; in the `calloc' case, that is the
     total size computed from both function arguments.  In the
     `realloc' case, $ARG2 is the pointer to the memory area being
     resized.  In the `memalign' case, $ARG2 is the alignment to be
     used for the request, which may be stricter than the value passed
     to the `memalign' function.  A `memalign' probe is also used by
     functions `posix_memalign, valloc' and `pvalloc'.

     Note that the argument order does _not_ match that of the
     corresponding two-argument functions, so that in all of these
     probes the user-requested allocation size is in $ARG1.

 -- Probe: memory_arena_retry (size_t $ARG1, void *$ARG2)
     This probe is triggered within `arena_get_retry' (the function
     called to select the alternate arena in which to retry an
     allocation that failed on the first attempt), before the selection
     of an alternate arena.  This probe is redundant, but much easier
     to use when it's not important to determine which of the various
     memory allocation functions is failing to allocate on the first
     try.  Argument $ARG1 is the same as in the function-specific
     probes, except for extra room for padding introduced by functions
     that have to ensure stricter alignment.  Argument $ARG2 is the
     arena in which allocation failed.

 -- Probe: memory_arena_new (void *$ARG1, size_t $ARG2)
     This probe is triggered when `malloc' allocates and initializes an
     additional arena (not the main arena), but before the arena is
     assigned to the running thread or inserted into the internal
     linked list of arenas.  The arena's `malloc_state' internal data
     structure is located at $ARG1, within a newly-allocated heap big
     enough to hold at least $ARG2 bytes.

 -- Probe: memory_arena_reuse (void *$ARG1, void *$ARG2)
     This probe is triggered when `malloc' has just selected an existing
     arena to reuse, and (temporarily) reserved it for exclusive use.
     Argument $ARG1 is a pointer to the newly-selected arena, and $ARG2
     is a pointer to the arena previously used by that thread.

     This occurs within `reused_arena', right after the mutex mentioned
     in probe `memory_arena_reuse_wait' is acquired; argument $ARG1 will
     point to the same arena.  In this configuration, this will usually
     only occur once per thread.  The exception is when a thread first
     selected the main arena, but a subsequent allocation from it
     fails: then, and only then, may we switch to another arena to
     retry that allocation, and for further allocations within that
     thread.

 -- Probe: memory_arena_reuse_wait (void *$ARG1, void *$ARG2, void
          *$ARG3)
     This probe is triggered when `malloc' is about to wait for an arena
     to become available for reuse.  Argument $ARG1 holds a pointer to
     the mutex the thread is going to wait on, $ARG2 is a pointer to a
     newly-chosen arena to be reused, and $ARG3 is a pointer to the
     arena previously used by that thread.

     This occurs within `reused_arena', when a thread first tries to
     allocate memory or needs a retry after a failure to allocate from
     the main arena, there isn't any free arena, the maximum number of
     arenas has been reached, and an existing arena was chosen for
     reuse, but its mutex could not be immediately acquired.  The mutex
     in $ARG1 is the mutex of the selected arena.

 -- Probe: memory_arena_reuse_free_list (void *$ARG1)
     This probe is triggered when `malloc' has chosen an arena that is
     in the free list for use by a thread, within the `get_free_list'
     function.  The argument $ARG1 holds a pointer to the selected
     arena.

 -- Probe: memory_mallopt (int $ARG1, int $ARG2)
     This probe is triggered when function `mallopt' is called to change
     `malloc' internal configuration parameters, before any change to
     the parameters is made.  The arguments $ARG1 and $ARG2 are the
     ones passed to the `mallopt' function.

 -- Probe: memory_mallopt_mxfast (int $ARG1, int $ARG2)
     This probe is triggered shortly after the `memory_mallopt' probe,
     when the parameter to be changed is `M_MXFAST', and the requested
     value is in an acceptable range.  Argument $ARG1 is the requested
     value, and $ARG2 is the previous value of this `malloc' parameter.

 -- Probe: memory_mallopt_trim_threshold (int $ARG1, int $ARG2, int
          $ARG3)
     This probe is triggered shortly after the `memory_mallopt' probe,
     when the parameter to be changed is `M_TRIM_THRESHOLD'.  Argument
     $ARG1 is the requested value, $ARG2 is the previous value of this
     `malloc' parameter, and $ARG3 is nonzero if dynamic threshold
     adjustment was already disabled.

 -- Probe: memory_mallopt_top_pad (int $ARG1, int $ARG2, int $ARG3)
     This probe is triggered shortly after the `memory_mallopt' probe,
     when the parameter to be changed is `M_TOP_PAD'.  Argument $ARG1
     is the requested value, $ARG2 is the previous value of this
     `malloc' parameter, and $ARG3 is nonzero if dynamic threshold
     adjustment was already disabled.

 -- Probe: memory_mallopt_mmap_threshold (int $ARG1, int $ARG2, int
          $ARG3)
     This probe is triggered shortly after the `memory_mallopt' probe,
     when the parameter to be changed is `M_MMAP_THRESHOLD', and the
     requested value is in an acceptable range.  Argument $ARG1 is the
     requested value, $ARG2 is the previous value of this `malloc'
     parameter, and $ARG3 is nonzero if dynamic threshold adjustment
     was already disabled.

 -- Probe: memory_mallopt_mmap_max (int $ARG1, int $ARG2, int $ARG3)
     This probe is triggered shortly after the `memory_mallopt' probe,
     when the parameter to be changed is `M_MMAP_MAX'.  Argument $ARG1
     is the requested value, $ARG2 is the previous value of this
     `malloc' parameter, and $ARG3 is nonzero if dynamic threshold
     adjustment was already disabled.

 -- Probe: memory_mallopt_perturb (int $ARG1, int $ARG2)
     This probe is triggered shortly after the `memory_mallopt' probe,
     when the parameter to be changed is `M_PERTURB'.  Argument $ARG1
     is the requested value, and $ARG2 is the previous value of this
     `malloc' parameter.

 -- Probe: memory_mallopt_arena_test (int $ARG1, int $ARG2)
     This probe is triggered shortly after the `memory_mallopt' probe,
     when the parameter to be changed is `M_ARENA_TEST', and the
     requested value is in an acceptable range.  Argument $ARG1 is the
     requested value, and $ARG2 is the previous value of this `malloc'
     parameter.

 -- Probe: memory_mallopt_arena_max (int $ARG1, int $ARG2)
     This probe is triggered shortly after the `memory_mallopt' probe,
     when the parameter to be changed is `M_ARENA_MAX', and the
     requested value is in an acceptable range.  Argument $ARG1 is the
     requested value, and $ARG2 is the previous value of this `malloc'
     parameter.

 -- Probe: memory_mallopt_free_dyn_thresholds (int $ARG1, int $ARG2)
     This probe is triggered when function `free' decides to adjust the
     dynamic brk/mmap thresholds.  Argument $ARG1 and $ARG2 are the
     adjusted mmap and trim thresholds, respectively.

 -- Probe: memory_tunable_tcache_max_bytes (int $ARG1, int $ARG2)
     This probe is triggered when the `glibc.malloc.tcache_max' tunable
     is set.  Argument $ARG1 is the requested value, and $ARG2 is the
     previous value of this tunable.

 -- Probe: memory_tunable_tcache_count (int $ARG1, int $ARG2)
     This probe is triggered when the `glibc.malloc.tcache_count'
     tunable is set.  Argument $ARG1 is the requested value, and $ARG2
     is the previous value of this tunable.

 -- Probe: memory_tunable_tcache_unsorted_limit (int $ARG1, int $ARG2)
     This probe is triggered when the
     `glibc.malloc.tcache_unsorted_limit' tunable is set.  Argument
     $ARG1 is the requested value, and $ARG2 is the previous value of
     this tunable.

 -- Probe: memory_tcache_double_free (void *$ARG1, int $ARG2)
     This probe is triggered when `free' determines that the memory
     being freed has probably already been freed, and resides in the
     per-thread cache.  Note that there is an extremely unlikely chance
     that this probe will trigger due to random payload data remaining
     in the allocated memory matching the key used to detect double
     frees.  This probe actually indicates that an expensive linear
     search of the tcache, looking for a double free, has happened.
     Argument $ARG1 is the memory location as passed to `free',
     Argument $ARG2 is the tcache bin it resides in.

36.2 Mathematical Function Probes
=================================

Some mathematical functions fall back to multiple precision arithmetic
for some inputs to get last bit precision for their return values.
This multiple precision fallback is much slower than the default
algorithms and may have a significant impact on application
performance.  The systemtap probe markers described in this section may
help you determine if your application calls mathematical functions
with inputs that may result in multiple-precision arithmetic.

   Unless explicitly mentioned otherwise, a precision of 1 implies 24
bits of precision in the mantissa of the multiple precision number.
Hence, a precision level of 32 implies 768 bits of precision in the
mantissa.

36.3 Non-local Goto Probes
==========================

These probes are used to signal calls to `setjmp', `sigsetjmp',
`longjmp' or `siglongjmp'.

 -- Probe: setjmp (void *$ARG1, int $ARG2, void *$ARG3)
     This probe is triggered whenever `setjmp' or `sigsetjmp' is

37 Tunables
***********

"Tunables" are a feature in the GNU C Library that allows application
authors and distribution maintainers to alter the runtime library
behavior to match their workload. These are implemented as a set of
switches that may be modified in different ways. The current default
method to do this is via the `GLIBC_TUNABLES' environment variable by
setting it to a string of colon-separated NAME=VALUE pairs.  For
example, the following example enables malloc checking and sets the
malloc trim threshold to 128 bytes:

     GLIBC_TUNABLES=glibc.malloc.trim_threshold=128:glibc.malloc.check=3
     export GLIBC_TUNABLES

   Tunables are not part of the GNU C Library stable ABI, and they are
subject to change or removal across releases.  Additionally, the method
to modify tunable values may change between releases and across
distributions.  It is possible to implement multiple `frontends' for
the tunables allowing distributions to choose their preferred method at
build time.

   Finally, the set of tunables available may vary between
distributions as the tunables feature allows distributions to add their
own tunables under their own namespace.

37.1 Tunable names
==================

A tunable name is split into three components, a top namespace, a
tunable namespace and the tunable name. The top namespace for tunables
implemented in the GNU C Library is `glibc'. Distributions that choose
to add custom tunables in their maintained versions of the GNU C
Library may choose to do so under their own top namespace.

   The tunable namespace is a logical grouping of tunables in a single
module. This currently holds no special significance, although that may
change in the future.

   The tunable name is the actual name of the tunable. It is possible
that different tunable namespaces may have tunables within them that
have the same name, likewise for top namespaces. Hence, we only support
identification of tunables by their full name, i.e. with the top
namespace, tunable namespace and tunable name, separated by periods.


File: libc.info,  Node: Memory Allocation Tunables,  Next: Dynamic Linking Tunables,  Prev: Tunable names,  Up: Tunables

37.2 Memory Allocation Tunables
===============================

 -- Tunable namespace: glibc.malloc
     Memory allocation behavior can be modified by setting any of the
     following tunables in the `malloc' namespace:

 -- Tunable: glibc.malloc.check
     This tunable supersedes the `MALLOC_CHECK_' environment variable
     and is identical in features.

     Setting this tunable to a non-zero value enables a special (less
     efficient) memory allocator for the malloc family of functions
     that is designed to be tolerant against simple errors such as
     double calls of free with the same argument, or overruns of a
     single byte (off-by-one bugs). Not all such errors can be
     protected against, however, and memory leaks can result.  Any
     detected heap corruption results in immediate termination of the
     process.

     Like `MALLOC_CHECK_', `glibc.malloc.check' has a problem in that it
     diverges from normal program behavior by writing to `stderr',
     which could by exploited in SUID and SGID binaries.  Therefore,
     `glibc.malloc.check' is disabled by default for SUID and SGID
     binaries.  This can be enabled again by the system administrator
     by adding a file `/etc/suid-debug'; the content of the file could
     be anything or even empty.

 -- Tunable: glibc.malloc.top_pad
     This tunable supersedes the `MALLOC_TOP_PAD_' environment variable
     and is identical in features.

     This tunable determines the amount of extra memory in bytes to
     obtain from the system when any of the arenas need to be extended.
     It also specifies the number of bytes to retain when shrinking any
     of the arenas.  This provides the necessary hysteresis in heap
     size such that excessive amounts of system calls can be avoided.

     The default value of this tunable is `0'.

 -- Tunable: glibc.malloc.perturb
     This tunable supersedes the `MALLOC_PERTURB_' environment variable
     and is identical in features.

     If set to a non-zero value, memory blocks are initialized with
     values depending on some low order bits of this tunable when they
     are allocated (except when allocated by calloc) and freed.  This
     can be used to debug the use of uninitialized or freed heap
     memory. Note that this option does not guarantee that the freed
     block will have any specific values. It only guarantees that the
     content the block had before it was freed will be overwritten.

     The default value of this tunable is `0'.

 -- Tunable: glibc.malloc.mmap_threshold
     This tunable supersedes the `MALLOC_MMAP_THRESHOLD_' environment
     variable and is identical in features.

     When this tunable is set, all chunks larger than this value in
     bytes are allocated outside the normal heap, using the `mmap'
     system call. This way it is guaranteed that the memory for these
     chunks can be returned to the system on `free'. Note that requests
     smaller than this threshold might still be allocated via `mmap'.

     If this tunable is not set, the default value is set to `131072'
     bytes and the threshold is adjusted dynamically to suit the
     allocation patterns of the program.  If the tunable is set, the
     dynamic adjustment is disabled and the value is set as static.

 -- Tunable: glibc.malloc.trim_threshold
     This tunable supersedes the `MALLOC_TRIM_THRESHOLD_' environment
     variable and is identical in features.

     The value of this tunable is the minimum size (in bytes) of the
     top-most, releasable chunk in an arena that will trigger a system
     call in order to return memory to the system from that arena.

     If this tunable is not set, the default value is set as 128 KB and
     the threshold is adjusted dynamically to suit the allocation
     patterns of the program.  If the tunable is set, the dynamic
     adjustment is disabled and the value is set as static.

 -- Tunable: glibc.malloc.mmap_max
     This tunable supersedes the `MALLOC_MMAP_MAX_' environment
     variable and is identical in features.

     The value of this tunable is maximum number of chunks to allocate
     with `mmap'.  Setting this to zero disables all use of `mmap'.

     The default value of this tunable is `65536'.

 -- Tunable: glibc.malloc.arena_test
     This tunable supersedes the `MALLOC_ARENA_TEST' environment
     variable and is identical in features.

     The `glibc.malloc.arena_test' tunable specifies the number of
     arenas that can be created before the test on the limit to the
     number of arenas is conducted.  The value is ignored if
     `glibc.malloc.arena_max' is set.

     The default value of this tunable is 2 for 32-bit systems and 8
     for 64-bit systems.

 -- Tunable: glibc.malloc.arena_max
     This tunable supersedes the `MALLOC_ARENA_MAX' environment
     variable and is identical in features.

     This tunable sets the number of arenas to use in a process
     regardless of the number of cores in the system.

     The default value of this tunable is `0', meaning that the limit
     on the number of arenas is determined by the number of CPU cores
     online.  For 32-bit systems the limit is twice the number of cores
     online and on 64-bit systems, it is 8 times the number of cores
     online.

 -- Tunable: glibc.malloc.tcache_max
     The maximum size of a request (in bytes) which may be met via the
     per-thread cache.  The default (and maximum) value is 1032 bytes on
     64-bit systems and 516 bytes on 32-bit systems.

 -- Tunable: glibc.malloc.tcache_count
     The maximum number of chunks of each size to cache. The default is
     7.  The upper limit is 65535.  If set to zero, the per-thread
     cache is effectively disabled.

     The approximate maximum overhead of the per-thread cache is thus
     equal to the number of bins times the chunk count in each bin
     times the size of each chunk.  With defaults, the approximate
     maximum overhead of the per-thread cache is approximately 236 KB
     on 64-bit systems and 118 KB on 32-bit systems.

 -- Tunable: glibc.malloc.tcache_unsorted_limit
     When the user requests memory and the request cannot be met via the
     per-thread cache, the arenas are used to meet the request.  At this
     time, additional chunks will be moved from existing arena lists to
     pre-fill the corresponding cache.  While copies from the fastbins,
     smallbins, and regular bins are bounded and predictable due to the
     bin sizes, copies from the unsorted bin are not bounded, and incur
     additional time penalties as they need to be sorted as they're
     scanned.  To make scanning the unsorted list more predictable and
     bounded, the user may set this tunable to limit the number of
     chunks that are scanned from the unsorted list while searching for
     chunks to pre-fill the per-thread cache with.  The default, or
     when set to zero, is no limit.

 -- Tunable: glibc.malloc.mxfast
     One of the optimizations malloc uses is to maintain a series of
     "fast bins" that hold chunks up to a specific size.  The default
     and maximum size which may be held this way is 80 bytes on 32-bit
     systems or 160 bytes on 64-bit systems.  Applications which value
     size over speed may choose to reduce the size of requests which
     are serviced from fast bins with this tunable.  Note that the
     value specified includes malloc's internal overhead, which is
     normally the size of one pointer, so add 4 on 32-bit systems or 8
     on 64-bit systems to the size passed to `malloc' for the largest
     bin size to enable.

37.3 Dynamic Linking Tunables
=============================

 -- Tunable namespace: glibc.rtld
     Dynamic linker behavior can be modified by setting the following
     tunables in the `rtld' namespace:

 -- Tunable: glibc.rtld.nns
     Sets the number of supported dynamic link namespaces (see
     `dlmopen').  Currently this limit can be set between 1 and 16
     inclusive, the default is 4.  Each link namespace consumes some
     memory in all thread, and thus raising the limit will increase the
     amount of memory each thread uses. Raising the limit is useful
     when your application uses more than 4 dynamic link namespaces as
     created by `dlmopen' with an lmid argument of `LM_ID_NEWLM'.
     Dynamic linker audit modules are loaded in their own dynamic link
     namespaces, but they are not accounted for in `glibc.rtld.nns'.
     They implicitly increase the per-thread memory usage as necessary,
     so this tunable does not need to be changed to allow many audit
     modules e.g. via `LD_AUDIT'.

 -- Tunable: glibc.rtld.optional_static_tls
     Sets the amount of surplus static TLS in bytes to allocate at
     program startup.  Every thread created allocates this amount of
     specified surplus static TLS. This is a minimum value and
     additional space may be allocated for internal purposes including
     alignment.  Optional static TLS is used for optimizing dynamic TLS
     access for platforms that support such optimizations e.g. TLS
     descriptors or optimized TLS access for POWER (`DT_PPC64_OPT' and
     `DT_PPC_OPT').  In order to make the best use of such optimizations
     the value should be as many bytes as would be required to hold all
     TLS variables in all dynamic loaded shared libraries.  The value
     cannot be known by the dynamic loader because it doesn't know the
     expected set of shared libraries which will be loaded.  The
     existing static TLS space cannot be changed once allocated at
     process startup.  The default allocation of optional static TLS is
     512 bytes and is allocated in every thread.

37.4 Elision Tunables
=====================

 -- Tunable namespace: glibc.elision
     Contended locks are usually slow and can lead to performance and
     scalability issues in multithread code. Lock elision will use
     memory transactions to under certain conditions, to elide locks
     and improve performance.  Elision behavior can be modified by
     setting the following tunables in the `elision' namespace:

 -- Tunable: glibc.elision.enable
     The `glibc.elision.enable' tunable enables lock elision if the
     feature is supported by the hardware.  If elision is not supported
     by the hardware this tunable has no effect.

     Elision tunables are supported for 64-bit Intel, IBM POWER, and z
     System architectures.

 -- Tunable: glibc.elision.skip_lock_busy
     The `glibc.elision.skip_lock_busy' tunable sets how many times to
     use a non-transactional lock after a transactional failure has
     occurred because the lock is already acquired.  Expressed in
     number of lock acquisition attempts.

     The default value of this tunable is `3'.

 -- Tunable: glibc.elision.skip_lock_internal_abort
     The `glibc.elision.skip_lock_internal_abort' tunable sets how many
     times the thread should avoid using elision if a transaction
     aborted for any reason other than a different thread's memory
     accesses.  Expressed in number of lock acquisition attempts.

     The default value of this tunable is `3'.

 -- Tunable: glibc.elision.skip_lock_after_retries
     The `glibc.elision.skip_lock_after_retries' tunable sets how many
     times to try to elide a lock with transactions, that only failed
     due to a different thread's memory accesses, before falling back
     to regular lock.  Expressed in number of lock elision attempts.

     This tunable is supported only on IBM POWER, and z System
     architectures.

     The default value of this tunable is `3'.

 -- Tunable: glibc.elision.tries
     The `glibc.elision.tries' sets how many times to retry elision if
     there is chance for the transaction to finish execution e.g., it
     wasn't aborted due to the lock being already acquired.  If elision
     is not supported by the hardware this tunable is set to `0' to
     avoid retries.

     The default value of this tunable is `3'.

 -- Tunable: glibc.elision.skip_trylock_internal_abort
     The `glibc.elision.skip_trylock_internal_abort' tunable sets how
     many times the thread should avoid trying the lock if a
     transaction aborted due to reasons other than a different thread's
     memory accesses.  Expressed in number of try lock attempts.

     The default value of this tunable is `3'.

37.5 POSIX Thread Tunables
==========================

 -- Tunable namespace: glibc.pthread
     The behavior of POSIX threads can be tuned to gain performance
     improvements according to specific hardware capabilities and
     workload characteristics by setting the following tunables in the
     `pthread' namespace:

 -- Tunable: glibc.pthread.mutex_spin_count
     The `glibc.pthread.mutex_spin_count' tunable sets the maximum
     number of times a thread should spin on the lock before calling
     into the kernel to block.  Adaptive spin is used for mutexes
     initialized with the `PTHREAD_MUTEX_ADAPTIVE_NP' GNU extension.
     It affects both `pthread_mutex_lock' and `pthread_mutex_timedlock'.

     The thread spins until either the maximum spin count is reached or
     the lock is acquired.

     The default value of this tunable is `100'.

37.6 Hardware Capability Tunables
=================================

 -- Tunable namespace: glibc.cpu
     Behavior of the GNU C Library can be tuned to assume specific
     hardware capabilities by setting the following tunables in the
     `cpu' namespace:

 -- Tunable: glibc.cpu.hwcap_mask
     This tunable supersedes the `LD_HWCAP_MASK' environment variable
     and is identical in features.

     The `AT_HWCAP' key in the Auxiliary Vector specifies instruction
     set extensions available in the processor at runtime for some
     architectures.  The `glibc.cpu.hwcap_mask' tunable allows the user
     to mask out those capabilities at runtime, thus disabling use of
     those extensions.

 -- Tunable: glibc.cpu.hwcaps
     The `glibc.cpu.hwcaps=-xxx,yyy,-zzz...' tunable allows the user to
     enable CPU/ARCH feature `yyy', disable CPU/ARCH feature `xxx' and
     `zzz' where the feature name is case-sensitive and has to match
     the ones in `sysdeps/x86/cpu-features.h'.

     This tunable is specific to i386 and x86-64.

 -- Tunable: glibc.cpu.cached_memopt
     The `glibc.cpu.cached_memopt=[0|1]' tunable allows the user to
     enable optimizations recommended for cacheable memory.  If set to
     `1', the GNU C Library assumes that the process memory image
     consists of cacheable (non-device) memory only.  The default, `0',
     indicates that the process may use device memory.

     This tunable is specific to powerpc, powerpc64 and powerpc64le.

 -- Tunable: glibc.cpu.name
     The `glibc.cpu.name=xxx' tunable allows the user to tell the GNU C
     Library to assume that the CPU is `xxx' where xxx may have one of
     these values: `generic', `falkor', `thunderxt88', `thunderx2t99',
     `thunderx2t99p1', `ares', `emag', `kunpeng'.

     This tunable is specific to aarch64.

 -- Tunable: glibc.cpu.x86_data_cache_size
     The `glibc.cpu.x86_data_cache_size' tunable allows the user to set
     data cache size in bytes for use in memory and string routines.

     This tunable is specific to i386 and x86-64.

 -- Tunable: glibc.cpu.x86_shared_cache_size
     The `glibc.cpu.x86_shared_cache_size' tunable allows the user to
     set shared cache size in bytes for use in memory and string
     routines.

 -- Tunable: glibc.cpu.x86_non_temporal_threshold
     The `glibc.cpu.x86_non_temporal_threshold' tunable allows the user
     to set threshold in bytes for non temporal store. Non temporal
     stores give a hint to the hardware to move data directly to memory
     without displacing other data from the cache. This tunable is used
     by some platforms to determine when to use non temporal stores in
     operations like memmove and memcpy.

     This tunable is specific to i386 and x86-64.

 -- Tunable: glibc.cpu.x86_rep_movsb_threshold
     The `glibc.cpu.x86_rep_movsb_threshold' tunable allows the user to
     set threshold in bytes to start using "rep movsb".  The value must
     be greater than zero, and currently defaults to 2048 bytes.

     This tunable is specific to i386 and x86-64.

 -- Tunable: glibc.cpu.x86_rep_stosb_threshold
     The `glibc.cpu.x86_rep_stosb_threshold' tunable allows the user to
     set threshold in bytes to start using "rep stosb".  The value must
     be greater than zero, and currently defaults to 2048 bytes.

     This tunable is specific to i386 and x86-64.

 -- Tunable: glibc.cpu.x86_ibt
     The `glibc.cpu.x86_ibt' tunable allows the user to control how
     indirect branch tracking (IBT) should be enabled.  Accepted values
     are `on', `off', and `permissive'.  `on' always turns on IBT
     regardless of whether IBT is enabled in the executable and its
     dependent shared libraries.  `off' always turns off IBT regardless
     of whether IBT is enabled in the executable and its dependent
     shared libraries.  `permissive' is the same as the default which
     disables IBT on non-CET executables and shared libraries.

     This tunable is specific to i386 and x86-64.

 -- Tunable: glibc.cpu.x86_shstk
     The `glibc.cpu.x86_shstk' tunable allows the user to control how
     the shadow stack (SHSTK) should be enabled.  Accepted values are
     `on', `off', and `permissive'.  `on' always turns on SHSTK
     regardless of whether SHSTK is enabled in the executable and its
     dependent shared libraries.  `off' always turns off SHSTK
     regardless of whether SHSTK is enabled in the executable and its
     dependent shared libraries.  `permissive' changes how dlopen works
     on non-CET shared libraries.  By default, when SHSTK is enabled,
     dlopening a non-CET shared library returns an error.  With
     `permissive', it turns off SHSTK instead.

     This tunable is specific to i386 and x86-64.

features has been written, we are publishing it here.

File: libc.info,  Node: Consistency Checking,  Next: Variadic Functions,  Up: Language Features

A.1 Explicitly Checking Internal Consistency
============================================

When you're writing a program, it's often a good idea to put in checks
at strategic places for "impossible" errors or violations of basic
assumptions.  These kinds of checks are helpful in debugging problems
with the interfaces between different parts of the program, for example.

   The `assert' macro, defined in the header file `assert.h', provides
a convenient way to abort the program while printing a message about
where in the program the error was detected.

   Once you think your program is debugged, you can disable the error
checks performed by the `assert' macro by recompiling with the macro
`NDEBUG' defined.  This means you don't actually have to change the
program source code to disable these checks.

   But disabling these consistency checks is undesirable unless they
make the program significantly slower.  All else being equal, more error
checking is good no matter who is running the program.  A wise user
would rather have a program crash, visibly, than have it return nonsense
without indicating anything might be wrong.

 -- Macro: void assert (int EXPRESSION)
     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Unsafe heap corrupt | AC-Unsafe mem
     lock corrupt | *Note POSIX Safety Concepts::.

     Verify the programmer's belief that EXPRESSION is nonzero at this
     point in the program.

     If `NDEBUG' is not defined, `assert' tests the value of
     EXPRESSION.  If it is false (zero), `assert' aborts the program
     (*note Aborting a Program::) after printing a message of the form:

          `FILE':LINENUM: FUNCTION: Assertion `EXPRESSION' failed.

     on the standard error stream `stderr' (*note Standard Streams::).
     The filename and line number are taken from the C preprocessor
     macros `__FILE__' and `__LINE__' and specify where the call to
     `assert' was made.  When using the GNU C compiler, the name of the
     function which calls `assert' is taken from the built-in variable
     `__PRETTY_FUNCTION__'; with older compilers, the function name and
     following colon are omitted.

     If the preprocessor macro `NDEBUG' is defined before `assert.h' is
     included, the `assert' macro is defined to do absolutely nothing.

     *Warning:* Even the argument expression EXPRESSION is not
     evaluated if `NDEBUG' is in effect.  So never use `assert' with
     arguments that involve side effects.  For example, `assert (++i >
     0);' is a bad idea, because `i' will not be incremented if
     `NDEBUG' is defined.

   Sometimes the "impossible" condition you want to check for is an
error return from an operating system function.  Then it is useful to
display not only where the program crashes, but also what error was
returned.  The `assert_perror' macro makes this easy.

 -- Macro: void assert_perror (int ERRNUM)
     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Unsafe heap corrupt | AC-Unsafe mem
     lock corrupt | *Note POSIX Safety Concepts::.

     Similar to `assert', but verifies that ERRNUM is zero.

     If `NDEBUG' is not defined, `assert_perror' tests the value of
     ERRNUM.  If it is nonzero, `assert_perror' aborts the program
     after printing a message of the form:

          `FILE':LINENUM: FUNCTION: ERROR TEXT

     on the standard error stream.  The file name, line number, and
     function name are as for `assert'.  The error text is the result of
     `strerror (ERRNUM)'.  *Note Error Messages::.

     Like `assert', if `NDEBUG' is defined before `assert.h' is
     included, the `assert_perror' macro does absolutely nothing.  It
     does not evaluate the argument, so ERRNUM should not have any side
     effects.  It is best for ERRNUM to be just a simple variable
     reference; often it will be `errno'.

     This macro is a GNU extension.

   *Usage note:* The `assert' facility is designed for detecting
_internal inconsistency_; it is not suitable for reporting invalid
input or improper usage by the _user_ of the program.

   The information in the diagnostic messages printed by the `assert'
and `assert_perror' macro is intended to help you, the programmer,
track down the cause of a bug, but is not really useful for telling a
user of your program why his or her input was invalid or why a command
could not be carried out.  What's more, your program should not abort
when given invalid input, as `assert' would do--it should exit with
nonzero status (*note Exit Status::) after printing its error messages,
or perhaps read another command or move on to the next input file.

   *Note Error Messages::, for information on printing error messages
for problems that _do not_ represent bugs in the program.

A.2 Variadic Functions
======================

ISO C defines a syntax for declaring a function to take a variable
number or type of arguments.  (Such functions are referred to as
"varargs functions" or "variadic functions".)  However, the language
itself provides no mechanism for such functions to access their
non-required arguments; instead, you use the variable arguments macros
defined in `stdarg.h'.

   This section describes how to declare variadic functions, how to
write them, and how to call them properly.

   *Compatibility Note:* Many older C dialects provide a similar, but
incompatible, mechanism for defining functions with variable numbers of
arguments, using `varargs.h'.

* Menu:

* Why Variadic::                Reasons for making functions take
                                 variable arguments.
* How Variadic::                How to define and call variadic functions.
* Variadic Example::            A complete example.


File: libc.info,  Node: Why Variadic,  Next: How Variadic,  Up: Variadic Functions

A.2.1 Why Variadic Functions are Used
-------------------------------------

Ordinary C functions take a fixed number of arguments.  When you define
a function, you specify the data type for each argument.  Every call to
the function should supply the expected number of arguments, with types
that can be converted to the specified ones.  Thus, if the function
`foo' is declared with `int foo (int, char *);' then you must call it
with two arguments, a number (any kind will do) and a string pointer.

   But some functions perform operations that can meaningfully accept an
unlimited number of arguments.

   In some cases a function can handle any number of values by
operating on all of them as a block.  For example, consider a function
that allocates a one-dimensional array with `malloc' to hold a
specified set of values.  This operation makes sense for any number of
values, as long as the length of the array corresponds to that number.
Without facilities for variable arguments, you would have to define a
separate function for each possible array size.

   The library function `printf' (*note Formatted Output::) is an
example of another class of function where variable arguments are
useful.  This function prints its arguments (which can vary in type as
well as number) under the control of a format template string.

   These are good reasons to define a "variadic" function which can
handle as many arguments as the caller chooses to pass.

   Some functions such as `open' take a fixed set of arguments, but
occasionally ignore the last few.  Strict adherence to ISO C requires
these functions to be defined as variadic; in practice, however, the GNU
C compiler and most other C compilers let you define such a function to
take a fixed set of arguments--the most it can ever use--and then only
_declare_ the function as variadic (or not declare its arguments at
all!).


File: libc.info,  Node: How Variadic,  Next: Variadic Example,  Prev: Why Variadic,  Up: Variadic Functions

A.2.2 How Variadic Functions are Defined and Used
-------------------------------------------------

Defining and using a variadic function involves three steps:

   * _Define_ the function as variadic, using an ellipsis (`...') in
     the argument list, and using special macros to access the variable
     arguments.  *Note Receiving Arguments::.

   * _Declare_ the function as variadic, using a prototype with an
     ellipsis (`...'), in all the files which call it.  *Note Variadic
     Prototypes::.

   * _Call_ the function by writing the fixed arguments followed by the
     additional variable arguments.  *Note Calling Variadics::.

File: libc.info,  Node: Variadic Prototypes,  Next: Receiving Arguments,  Up: How Variadic

A.2.2.1 Syntax for Variable Arguments
.....................................

A function that accepts a variable number of arguments must be declared
with a prototype that says so.   You write the fixed arguments as usual,
and then tack on `...' to indicate the possibility of additional
arguments.  The syntax of ISO C requires at least one fixed argument
before the `...'.  For example,

     int
     func (const char *a, int b, ...)
     {
       ...
     }

defines a function `func' which returns an `int' and takes two required
arguments, a `const char *' and an `int'.  These are followed by any
number of anonymous arguments.

   *Portability note:* For some C compilers, the last required argument
must not be declared `register' in the function definition.
Furthermore, this argument's type must be "self-promoting": that is,
the default promotions must not change its type.  This rules out array
and function types, as well as `float', `char' (whether signed or not)
and `short int' (whether signed or not).  This is actually an ISO C
requirement.


File: libc.info,  Node: Receiving Arguments,  Next: How Many Arguments,  Prev: Variadic Prototypes,  Up: How Variadic

A.2.2.2 Receiving the Argument Values
.....................................

Ordinary fixed arguments have individual names, and you can use these
names to access their values.  But optional arguments have no
names--nothing but `...'.  How can you access them?

   The only way to access them is sequentially, in the order they were
written, and you must use special macros from `stdarg.h' in the
following three step process:

  1. You initialize an argument pointer variable of type `va_list' using
     `va_start'.  The argument pointer when initialized points to the
     first optional argument.

  2. You access the optional arguments by successive calls to `va_arg'.
     The first call to `va_arg' gives you the first optional argument,
     the next call gives you the second, and so on.

     You can stop at any time if you wish to ignore any remaining
     optional arguments.  It is perfectly all right for a function to
     access fewer arguments than were supplied in the call, but you
     will get garbage values if you try to access too many arguments.

  3. You indicate that you are finished with the argument pointer
     variable by calling `va_end'.

     (In practice, with most C compilers, calling `va_end' does nothing.
     This is always true in the GNU C compiler.  But you might as well
     call `va_end' just in case your program is someday compiled with a
     peculiar compiler.)

   *Note Argument Macros::, for the full definitions of `va_start',
`va_arg' and `va_end'.

   Steps 1 and 3 must be performed in the function that accepts the
optional arguments.  However, you can pass the `va_list' variable as an
argument to another function and perform all or part of step 2 there.

   You can perform the entire sequence of three steps multiple times
within a single function invocation.  If you want to ignore the optional
arguments, you can do these steps zero times.

   You can have more than one argument pointer variable if you like.
You can initialize each variable with `va_start' when you wish, and
then you can fetch arguments with each argument pointer as you wish.
Each argument pointer variable will sequence through the same set of
argument values, but at its own pace.

   *Portability note:* With some compilers, once you pass an argument
pointer value to a subroutine, you must not keep using the same
argument pointer value after that subroutine returns.  For full
portability, you should just pass it to `va_end'.  This is actually an
ISO C requirement, but most ANSI C compilers work happily regardless.


File: libc.info,  Node: How Many Arguments,  Next: Calling Variadics,  Prev: Receiving Arguments,  Up: How Variadic

A.2.2.3 How Many Arguments Were Supplied
........................................

There is no general way for a function to determine the number and type
of the optional arguments it was called with.  So whoever designs the
function typically designs a convention for the caller to specify the
number and type of arguments.  It is up to you to define an appropriate
calling convention for each variadic function, and write all calls
accordingly.

   One kind of calling convention is to pass the number of optional
arguments as one of the fixed arguments.  This convention works provided
all of the optional arguments are of the same type.

   A similar alternative is to have one of the required arguments be a
bit mask, with a bit for each possible purpose for which an optional
argument might be supplied.  You would test the bits in a predefined
sequence; if the bit is set, fetch the value of the next argument,
otherwise use a default value.

   A required argument can be used as a pattern to specify both the
number and types of the optional arguments.  The format string argument
to `printf' is one example of this (*note Formatted Output Functions::).

   Another possibility is to pass an "end marker" value as the last
optional argument.  For example, for a function that manipulates an
arbitrary number of pointer arguments, a null pointer might indicate the
end of the argument list.  (This assumes that a null pointer isn't
otherwise meaningful to the function.)  The `execl' function works in
just this way; see *note Executing a File::.

A.2.2.4 Calling Variadic Functions
..................................

You don't have to do anything special to call a variadic function.
Just put the arguments (required arguments, followed by optional ones)
inside parentheses, separated by commas, as usual.  But you must declare
the function with a prototype and know how the argument values are
converted.

   In principle, functions that are _defined_ to be variadic must also
be _declared_ to be variadic using a function prototype whenever you
call them.  (*Note Variadic Prototypes::, for how.)  This is because
some C compilers use a different calling convention to pass the same set
of argument values to a function depending on whether that function
takes variable arguments or fixed arguments.

   In practice, the GNU C compiler always passes a given set of argument
types in the same way regardless of whether they are optional or
required.  So, as long as the argument types are self-promoting, you can
safely omit declaring them.  Usually it is a good idea to declare the
argument types for variadic functions, and indeed for all functions.
But there are a few functions which it is extremely convenient not to
have to declare as variadic--for example, `open' and `printf'.

   Since the prototype doesn't specify types for optional arguments, in
a call to a variadic function the "default argument promotions" are
performed on the optional argument values.  This means the objects of
type `char' or `short int' (whether signed or not) are promoted to
either `int' or `unsigned int', as appropriate; and that objects of
type `float' are promoted to type `double'.  So, if the caller passes a
`char' as an optional argument, it is promoted to an `int', and the
function can access it with `va_arg (AP, int)'.

   Conversion of the required arguments is controlled by the function
prototype in the usual way: the argument expression is converted to the
declared argument type as if it were being assigned to a variable of
that type.

A.2.2.5 Argument Access Macros
..............................

Here are descriptions of the macros used to retrieve variable arguments.
These macros are defined in the header file `stdarg.h'.  

 -- Data Type: va_list
     The type `va_list' is used for argument pointer variables.

 -- Macro: void va_start (va_list AP, LAST-REQUIRED)
     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Safe | AC-Safe | *Note POSIX Safety
     Concepts::.

     This macro initializes the argument pointer variable AP to point
     to the first of the optional arguments of the current function;
     LAST-REQUIRED must be the last required argument to the function.

 -- Macro: TYPE va_arg (va_list AP, TYPE)
     Preliminary: | MT-Safe race:ap | AS-Safe | AC-Unsafe corrupt |
     *Note POSIX Safety Concepts::.

     The `va_arg' macro returns the value of the next optional argument,
     and modifies the value of AP to point to the subsequent argument.
     Thus, successive uses of `va_arg' return successive optional
     arguments.

     The type of the value returned by `va_arg' is TYPE as specified in
     the call.  TYPE must be a self-promoting type (not `char' or
     `short int' or `float') that matches the type of the actual
     argument.

 -- Macro: void va_end (va_list AP)
     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Safe | AC-Safe | *Note POSIX Safety
     Concepts::.

     This ends the use of AP.  After a `va_end' call, further `va_arg'
     calls with the same AP may not work.  You should invoke `va_end'
     before returning from the function in which `va_start' was invoked
     with the same AP argument.

     In the GNU C Library, `va_end' does nothing, and you need not ever
     use it except for reasons of portability.


   Sometimes it is necessary to parse the list of parameters more than
once or one wants to remember a certain position in the parameter list.
To do this, one will have to make a copy of the current value of the
argument.  But `va_list' is an opaque type and one cannot necessarily
assign the value of one variable of type `va_list' to another variable
of the same type.

 -- Macro: void va_copy (va_list DEST, va_list SRC)
 -- Macro: void __va_copy (va_list DEST, va_list SRC)
     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Safe | AC-Safe | *Note POSIX Safety
     Concepts::.

     The `va_copy' macro allows copying of objects of type `va_list'
     even if this is not an integral type.  The argument pointer in
     DEST is initialized to point to the same argument as the pointer
     in SRC.

     `va_copy' was added in ISO C99.  When building for strict
     conformance to ISO C90 (`gcc -std=c90'), it is not available.  GCC
     provides `__va_copy', as an extension, in any standards mode;
     before GCC 3.0, it was the only macro for this functionality.

     These macros are no longer provided by the GNU C Library, but
     rather by the compiler.

   If you want to use `va_copy' and be portable to pre-C99 systems, you
should always be prepared for the possibility that this macro will not
be available.  On architectures where a simple assignment is invalid,
hopefully `va_copy' _will_ be available, so one should always write
something like this if concerned about pre-C99 portability:

     {
       va_list ap, save;
       ...
     #ifdef va_copy
       va_copy (save, ap);
     #else
       save = ap;
     #endif
       ...
     }

A.2.3 Example of a Variadic Function
------------------------------------

Here is a complete sample function that accepts a variable number of
arguments.  The first argument to the function is the count of remaining
arguments, which are added up and the result returned.  While trivial,
this function is sufficient to illustrate how to use the variable
arguments facility.


     #include <stdarg.h>
     #include <stdio.h>

     int
     add_em_up (int count,...)
     {
       va_list ap;
       int i, sum;

       va_start (ap, count);         /* Initialize the argument list. */

       sum = 0;
       for (i = 0; i < count; i++)
         sum += va_arg (ap, int);    /* Get the next argument value. */

       va_end (ap);                  /* Clean up. */
       return sum;
     }

     int
     main (void)
     {
       /* This call prints 16. */
       printf ("%d\n", add_em_up (3, 5, 5, 6));

       /* This call prints 55. */
       printf ("%d\n", add_em_up (10, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10));

       return 0;
     }

A.3 Null Pointer Constant
=========================

The null pointer constant is guaranteed not to point to any real object.
You can assign it to any pointer variable since it has type `void *'.
The preferred way to write a null pointer constant is with `NULL'.

 -- Macro: void * NULL
     This is a null pointer constant.

   You can also use `0' or `(void *)0' as a null pointer constant, but
using `NULL' is cleaner because it makes the purpose of the constant
more evident.

   If you use the null pointer constant as a function argument, then for
complete portability you should make sure that the function has a
prototype declaration.  Otherwise, if the target machine has two
different pointer representations, the compiler won't know which
representation to use for that argument.  You can avoid the problem by
explicitly casting the constant to the proper pointer type, but we
recommend instead adding a prototype for the function you are calling.


File: libc.info,  Node: Important Data Types,  Next: Data Type Measurements,  Prev: Null Pointer Constant,  Up: Language Features

A.4 Important Data Types
========================

The result of subtracting two pointers in C is always an integer, but
the precise data type varies from C compiler to C compiler.  Likewise,
the data type of the result of `sizeof' also varies between compilers.
ISO C defines standard aliases for these two types, so you can refer to
them in a portable fashion.  They are defined in the header file
`stddef.h'.  

 -- Data Type: ptrdiff_t
     This is the signed integer type of the result of subtracting two
     pointers.  For example, with the declaration `char *p1, *p2;', the
     expression `p2 - p1' is of type `ptrdiff_t'.  This will probably
     be one of the standard signed integer types (`short int', `int' or
     `long int'), but might be a nonstandard type that exists only for
     this purpose.

 -- Data Type: size_t
     This is an unsigned integer type used to represent the sizes of
     objects.  The result of the `sizeof' operator is of this type, and
     functions such as `malloc' (*note Unconstrained Allocation::) and
     `memcpy' (*note Copying Strings and Arrays::) accept arguments of
     this type to specify object sizes.  On systems using the GNU C
     Library, this will be `unsigned int' or `unsigned long int'.

     *Usage Note:* `size_t' is the preferred way to declare any
     arguments or variables that hold the size of an object.

   *Compatibility Note:* Implementations of C before the advent of
ISO C generally used `unsigned int' for representing object sizes and
`int' for pointer subtraction results.  They did not necessarily define
either `size_t' or `ptrdiff_t'.  Unix systems did define `size_t', in
`sys/types.h', but the definition was usually a signed type.

A.5 Data Type Measurements
==========================

Most of the time, if you choose the proper C data type for each object
in your program, you need not be concerned with just how it is
represented or how many bits it uses.  When you do need such
information, the C language itself does not provide a way to get it.
The header files `limits.h' and `float.h' contain macros which give you
this information in full detail.

* Menu:

* Width of Type::           How many bits does an integer type hold?
* Range of Type::           What are the largest and smallest values
			     that an integer type can hold?
* Floating Type Macros::    Parameters that measure the floating point types.
* Structure Measurement::   Getting measurements on structure types.


File: libc.info,  Node: Width of Type,  Next: Range of Type,  Up: Data Type Measurements

A.5.1 Width of an Integer Type
------------------------------

TS 18661-1:2014 defines macros for the width of integer types (the
number of value and sign bits).  One benefit of these macros is they
can be used in `#if' preprocessor directives, whereas `sizeof' cannot.
The following macros are defined in `limits.h'.

`CHAR_WIDTH'
`SCHAR_WIDTH'
`UCHAR_WIDTH'
`SHRT_WIDTH'
`USHRT_WIDTH'
`INT_WIDTH'
`UINT_WIDTH'
`LONG_WIDTH'
`ULONG_WIDTH'
`LLONG_WIDTH'
`ULLONG_WIDTH'
     These are the widths of the types `char', `signed char', `unsigned
     char', `short int', `unsigned short int', `int', `unsigned int',
     `long int', `unsigned long int', `long long int' and `unsigned
     long long int', respectively.

   Further such macros are defined in `stdint.h'.  Apart from those for
types specified by width (*note Integers::), the following are defined:

`INTPTR_WIDTH'
`UINTPTR_WIDTH'
`PTRDIFF_WIDTH'
`SIG_ATOMIC_WIDTH'
`SIZE_WIDTH'
`WCHAR_WIDTH'
`WINT_WIDTH'
     These are the widths of the types `intptr_t', `uintptr_t',
     `ptrdiff_t', `sig_atomic_t', `size_t', `wchar_t' and `wint_t',
     respectively.

   A common reason that a program needs to know how many bits are in an
integer type is for using an array of `unsigned long int' as a bit
vector.  You can access the bit at index N with:

     vector[N / ULONG_WIDTH] & (1UL << (N % ULONG_WIDTH))

   Before `ULONG_WIDTH' was a part of the C language, `CHAR_BIT' was
used to compute the number of bits in an integer data type.

 -- Macro: int CHAR_BIT
     This is the number of bits in a `char'.  POSIX.1-2001 requires
     this to be 8.

   The number of bits in any data type TYPE can be computed like this:

     sizeof (TYPE) * CHAR_BIT

   That expression includes padding bits as well as value and sign bits.
On all systems supported by the GNU C Library, standard integer types
other than `_Bool' do not have any padding bits.

   *Portability Note:* One cannot actually easily compute the number of
usable bits in a portable manner.

A.5.2 Range of an Integer Type
------------------------------

Suppose you need to store an integer value which can range from zero to
one million.  Which is the smallest type you can use?  There is no
general rule; it depends on the C compiler and target machine.  You can
use the `MIN' and `MAX' macros in `limits.h' to determine which type
will work.

   Each signed integer type has a pair of macros which give the smallest
and largest values that it can hold.  Each unsigned integer type has one
such macro, for the maximum value; the minimum value is, of course,
zero.

   The values of these macros are all integer constant expressions.  The
`MAX' and `MIN' macros for `char' and `short int' types have values of
type `int'.  The `MAX' and `MIN' macros for the other types have values
of the same type described by the macro--thus, `ULONG_MAX' has type
`unsigned long int'.

`SCHAR_MIN'
     This is the minimum value that can be represented by a
     `signed char'.

`SCHAR_MAX'
`UCHAR_MAX'
     These are the maximum values that can be represented by a
     `signed char' and `unsigned char', respectively.

`CHAR_MIN'
     This is the minimum value that can be represented by a `char'.
     It's equal to `SCHAR_MIN' if `char' is signed, or zero otherwise.

`CHAR_MAX'
     This is the maximum value that can be represented by a `char'.
     It's equal to `SCHAR_MAX' if `char' is signed, or `UCHAR_MAX'
     otherwise.

`SHRT_MIN'
     This is the minimum value that can be represented by a
     `signed short int'.  On most machines that the GNU C Library runs
     on, `short' integers are 16-bit quantities.

`SHRT_MAX'
`USHRT_MAX'
     These are the maximum values that can be represented by a
     `signed short int' and `unsigned short int', respectively.

`INT_MIN'
     This is the minimum value that can be represented by a
     `signed int'.  On most machines that the GNU C Library runs on, an
     `int' is a 32-bit quantity.

`INT_MAX'
`UINT_MAX'
     These are the maximum values that can be represented by,
     respectively, the type `signed int' and the type `unsigned int'.

`LONG_MIN'
     This is the minimum value that can be represented by a
     `signed long int'.  On most machines that the GNU C Library runs
     on, `long' integers are 32-bit quantities, the same size as `int'.

`LONG_MAX'
`ULONG_MAX'
     These are the maximum values that can be represented by a
     `signed long int' and `unsigned long int', respectively.

`LLONG_MIN'
     This is the minimum value that can be represented by a
     `signed long long int'.  On most machines that the GNU C Library
     runs on, `long long' integers are 64-bit quantities.

`LLONG_MAX'
`ULLONG_MAX'
     These are the maximum values that can be represented by a `signed
     long long int' and `unsigned long long int', respectively.

`LONG_LONG_MIN'
`LONG_LONG_MAX'
`ULONG_LONG_MAX'
     These are obsolete names for `LLONG_MIN', `LLONG_MAX', and
     `ULLONG_MAX'.  They are only available if `_GNU_SOURCE' is defined
     (*note Feature Test Macros::).  In GCC versions prior to 3.0,
     these were the only names available.

`WCHAR_MAX'
     This is the maximum value that can be represented by a `wchar_t'.
     *Note Extended Char Intro::.

   The header file `limits.h' also defines some additional constants
that parameterize various operating system and file system limits.
These constants are described in *note System Configuration::.

A.5.3 Floating Type Macros
--------------------------

The specific representation of floating point numbers varies from
machine to machine.  Because floating point numbers are represented
internally as approximate quantities, algorithms for manipulating
floating point data often need to take account of the precise details of
the machine's floating point representation.

   Some of the functions in the C library itself need this information;
for example, the algorithms for printing and reading floating point
numbers (*note I/O on Streams::) and for calculating trigonometric and
irrational functions (*note Mathematics::) use it to avoid round-off
error and loss of accuracy.  User programs that implement numerical
analysis techniques also often need this information in order to
minimize or compute error bounds.

   The header file `float.h' describes the format used by your machine.

A.5.3.1 Floating Point Representation Concepts
..............................................

This section introduces the terminology for describing floating point
representations.

   You are probably already familiar with most of these concepts in
terms of scientific or exponential notation for floating point numbers.
For example, the number `123456.0' could be expressed in exponential
notation as `1.23456e+05', a shorthand notation indicating that the
mantissa `1.23456' is multiplied by the base `10' raised to power `5'.

   More formally, the internal representation of a floating point number
can be characterized in terms of the following parameters:

   * The "sign" is either `-1' or `1'.

   * The "base" or "radix" for exponentiation, an integer greater than
     `1'.  This is a constant for a particular representation.

   * The "exponent" to which the base is raised.  The upper and lower
     bounds of the exponent value are constants for a particular
     representation.

     Sometimes, in the actual bits representing the floating point
     number, the exponent is "biased" by adding a constant to it, to
     make it always be represented as an unsigned quantity.  This is
     only important if you have some reason to pick apart the bit
     fields making up the floating point number by hand, which is
     something for which the GNU C Library provides no support.  So
     this is ignored in the discussion that follows.

   * The "mantissa" or "significand" is an unsigned integer which is a
     part of each floating point number.

   * The "precision" of the mantissa.  If the base of the representation
     is B, then the precision is the number of base-B digits in the
     mantissa.  This is a constant for a particular representation.

     Many floating point representations have an implicit "hidden bit"
     in the mantissa.  This is a bit which is present virtually in the
     mantissa, but not stored in memory because its value is always 1
     in a normalized number.  The precision figure (see above) includes
     any hidden bits.

     Again, the GNU C Library provides no facilities for dealing with
     such low-level aspects of the representation.

   The mantissa of a floating point number represents an implicit
fraction whose denominator is the base raised to the power of the
precision.  Since the largest representable mantissa is one less than
this denominator, the value of the fraction is always strictly less
than `1'.  The mathematical value of a floating point number is then
the product of this fraction, the sign, and the base raised to the
exponent.

   We say that the floating point number is "normalized" if the
fraction is at least `1/B', where B is the base.  In other words, the
mantissa would be too large to fit if it were multiplied by the base.
Non-normalized numbers are sometimes called "denormal"; they contain
less precision than the representation normally can hold.

   If the number is not normalized, then you can subtract `1' from the
exponent while multiplying the mantissa by the base, and get another
floating point number with the same value.  "Normalization" consists of
doing this repeatedly until the number is normalized.  Two distinct
normalized floating point numbers cannot be equal in value.

   (There is an exception to this rule: if the mantissa is zero, it is
considered normalized.  Another exception happens on certain machines
where the exponent is as small as the representation can hold.  Then it
is impossible to subtract `1' from the exponent, so a number may be
normalized even if its fraction is less than `1/B'.)


File: libc.info,  Node: Floating Point Parameters,  Next: IEEE Floating Point,  Prev: Floating Point Concepts,  Up: Floating Type Macros

A.5.3.2 Floating Point Parameters
.................................

These macro definitions can be accessed by including the header file
`float.h' in your program.

   Macro names starting with `FLT_' refer to the `float' type, while
names beginning with `DBL_' refer to the `double' type and names
beginning with `LDBL_' refer to the `long double' type.  (If GCC does
not support `long double' as a distinct data type on a target machine
then the values for the `LDBL_' constants are equal to the
corresponding constants for the `double' type.)

   Of these macros, only `FLT_RADIX' is guaranteed to be a constant
expression.  The other macros listed here cannot be reliably used in
places that require constant expressions, such as `#if' preprocessing
directives or in the dimensions of static arrays.

   Although the ISO C standard specifies minimum and maximum values for
most of these parameters, the GNU C implementation uses whatever values
describe the floating point representation of the target machine.  So in
principle GNU C actually satisfies the ISO C requirements only if the
target machine is suitable.  In practice, all the machines currently
supported are suitable.

`FLT_ROUNDS'
     This value characterizes the rounding mode for floating point
     addition.  The following values indicate standard rounding modes:

    `-1'
          The mode is indeterminable.

    `0'
          Rounding is towards zero.

    `1'
          Rounding is to the nearest number.

    `2'
          Rounding is towards positive infinity.

    `3'
          Rounding is towards negative infinity.

     Any other value represents a machine-dependent nonstandard rounding
     mode.

     On most machines, the value is `1', in accordance with the IEEE
     standard for floating point.

     Here is a table showing how certain values round for each possible
     value of `FLT_ROUNDS', if the other aspects of the representation
     match the IEEE single-precision standard.

                          0      1             2             3
           1.00000003    1.0    1.0           1.00000012    1.0
           1.00000007    1.0    1.00000012    1.00000012    1.0
          -1.00000003   -1.0   -1.0          -1.0          -1.00000012
          -1.00000007   -1.0   -1.00000012   -1.0          -1.00000012

`FLT_RADIX'
     This is the value of the base, or radix, of the exponent
     representation.  This is guaranteed to be a constant expression,
     unlike the other macros described in this section.  The value is 2
     on all machines we know of except the IBM 360 and derivatives.

`FLT_MANT_DIG'
     This is the number of base-`FLT_RADIX' digits in the floating point
     mantissa for the `float' data type.  The following expression
     yields `1.0' (even though mathematically it should not) due to the
     limited number of mantissa digits:

          float radix = FLT_RADIX;

          1.0f + 1.0f / radix / radix / ... / radix

     where `radix' appears `FLT_MANT_DIG' times.

`DBL_MANT_DIG'
`LDBL_MANT_DIG'
     This is the number of base-`FLT_RADIX' digits in the floating point
     mantissa for the data types `double' and `long double',
     respectively.

`FLT_DIG'
     This is the number of decimal digits of precision for the `float'
     data type.  Technically, if P and B are the precision and base
     (respectively) for the representation, then the decimal precision
     Q is the maximum number of decimal digits such that any floating
     point number with Q base 10 digits can be rounded to a floating
     point number with P base B digits and back again, without change
     to the Q decimal digits.

     The value of this macro is supposed to be at least `6', to satisfy
     ISO C.

`DBL_DIG'
`LDBL_DIG'
     These are similar to `FLT_DIG', but for the data types `double'
     and `long double', respectively.  The values of these macros are
     supposed to be at least `10'.

`FLT_MIN_EXP'
     This is the smallest possible exponent value for type `float'.
     More precisely, it is the minimum negative integer such that the
     value `FLT_RADIX' raised to this power minus 1 can be represented
     as a normalized floating point number of type `float'.

`DBL_MIN_EXP'
`LDBL_MIN_EXP'
     These are similar to `FLT_MIN_EXP', but for the data types
     `double' and `long double', respectively.

`FLT_MIN_10_EXP'
     This is the minimum negative integer such that `10' raised to this
     power minus 1 can be represented as a normalized floating point
     number of type `float'.  This is supposed to be `-37' or even less.

`DBL_MIN_10_EXP'
`LDBL_MIN_10_EXP'
     These are similar to `FLT_MIN_10_EXP', but for the data types
     `double' and `long double', respectively.

`FLT_MAX_EXP'
     This is the largest possible exponent value for type `float'.  More
     precisely, this is the maximum positive integer such that value
     `FLT_RADIX' raised to this power minus 1 can be represented as a
     floating point number of type `float'.

`DBL_MAX_EXP'
`LDBL_MAX_EXP'

     `double' and `long double', respectively.

`FLT_MAX_10_EXP'
     This is the maximum positive integer such that `10' raised to this
     power minus 1 can be represented as a normalized floating point
     number of type `float'.  This is supposed to be at least `37'.

`DBL_MAX_10_EXP'
`LDBL_MAX_10_EXP'
     These are similar to `FLT_MAX_10_EXP', but for the data types
     `double' and `long double', respectively.

`FLT_MAX'
     The value of this macro is the maximum number representable in type
     `float'.  It is supposed to be at least `1E+37'.  The value has
     type `float'.

     The smallest representable number is `- FLT_MAX'.

`DBL_MAX'
`LDBL_MAX'
     These are similar to `FLT_MAX', but for the data types `double'
     and `long double', respectively.  The type of the macro's value is
     the same as the type it describes.

`FLT_MIN'
     The value of this macro is the minimum normalized positive floating
     point number that is representable in type `float'.  It is supposed
     to be no more than `1E-37'.

`DBL_MIN'
`LDBL_MIN'
     These are similar to `FLT_MIN', but for the data types `double'
     and `long double', respectively.  The type of the macro's value is
     the same as the type it describes.

`FLT_EPSILON'
     This is the difference between 1 and the smallest floating point
     number of type `float' that is greater than 1.  It's supposed to
     be no greater than `1E-5'.

`DBL_EPSILON'
`LDBL_EPSILON'
     These are similar to `FLT_EPSILON', but for the data types
     `double' and `long double', respectively.  The type of the macro's
     value is the same as the type it describes.  The values are not
     supposed to be greater than `1E-9'.

A.5.3.3 IEEE Floating Point
...........................

Here is an example showing how the floating type measurements come out
for the most common floating point representation, specified by the
`IEEE Standard for Binary Floating Point Arithmetic (ANSI/IEEE Std
754-1985)'.  Nearly all computers designed since the 1980s use this
format.

   The IEEE single-precision float representation uses a base of 2.
There is a sign bit, a mantissa with 23 bits plus one hidden bit (so
the total precision is 24 base-2 digits), and an 8-bit exponent that
can represent values in the range -125 to 128, inclusive.

   So, for an implementation that uses this representation for the
`float' data type, appropriate values for the corresponding parameters
are:

     FLT_RADIX                             2
     FLT_MANT_DIG                         24
     FLT_DIG                               6
     FLT_MIN_EXP                        -125
     FLT_MIN_10_EXP                      -37
     FLT_MAX_EXP                         128
     FLT_MAX_10_EXP                      +38
     FLT_MIN                 1.17549435E-38F
     FLT_MAX                 3.40282347E+38F
     FLT_EPSILON             1.19209290E-07F

   Here are the values for the `double' data type:

     DBL_MANT_DIG                         53
     DBL_DIG                              15
     DBL_MIN_EXP                       -1021
     DBL_MIN_10_EXP                     -307
     DBL_MAX_EXP                        1024
     DBL_MAX_10_EXP                      308
     DBL_MAX         1.7976931348623157E+308
     DBL_MIN         2.2250738585072014E-308
     DBL_EPSILON     2.2204460492503131E-016

A.5.4 Structure Field Offset Measurement
----------------------------------------

You can use `offsetof' to measure the location within a structure type
of a particular structure member.

 -- Macro: size_t offsetof (TYPE, MEMBER)
     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Safe | AC-Safe | *Note POSIX Safety
     Concepts::.

     This expands to an integer constant expression that is the offset
     of the structure member named MEMBER in the structure type TYPE.
     For example, `offsetof (struct s, elem)' is the offset, in bytes,
     of the member `elem' in a `struct s'.

     This macro won't work if MEMBER is a bit field; you get an error
     from the C compiler in that case.
