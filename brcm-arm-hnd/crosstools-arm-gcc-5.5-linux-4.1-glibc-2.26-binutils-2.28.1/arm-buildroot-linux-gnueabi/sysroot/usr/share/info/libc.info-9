30.6 Setting the User ID
========================

This section describes the functions for altering the user ID (real
and/or effective) of a process.  To use these facilities, you must
include the header files `sys/types.h' and `unistd.h'.  

 -- Function: int seteuid (uid_t NEWEUID)
     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Unsafe lock | AC-Unsafe lock | *Note
     POSIX Safety Concepts::.

     This function sets the effective user ID of a process to NEWEUID,
     provided that the process is allowed to change its effective user
     ID.  A privileged process (effective user ID zero) can change its
     effective user ID to any legal value.  An unprivileged process
     with a file user ID can change its effective user ID to its real
     user ID or to its file user ID.  Otherwise, a process may not
     change its effective user ID at all.

     The `seteuid' function returns a value of `0' to indicate
     successful completion, and a value of `-1' to indicate an error.
     The following `errno' error conditions are defined for this
     function:

    `EINVAL'
          The value of the NEWEUID argument is invalid.

    `EPERM'
          The process may not change to the specified ID.

     Older systems (those without the `_POSIX_SAVED_IDS' feature) do not
     have this function.

 -- Function: int setuid (uid_t NEWUID)
     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Unsafe lock | AC-Unsafe lock | *Note
     POSIX Safety Concepts::.

     If the calling process is privileged, this function sets both the
     real and effective user IDs of the process to NEWUID.  It also
     deletes the file user ID of the process, if any.  NEWUID may be any
     legal value.  (Once this has been done, there is no way to recover
     the old effective user ID.)

     If the process is not privileged, and the system supports the
     `_POSIX_SAVED_IDS' feature, then this function behaves like
     `seteuid'.

     The return values and error conditions are the same as for
     `seteuid'.

 -- Function: int setreuid (uid_t RUID, uid_t EUID)
     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Unsafe lock | AC-Unsafe lock | *Note
     POSIX Safety Concepts::.

     This function sets the real user ID of the process to RUID and the
     effective user ID to EUID.  If RUID is `-1', it means not to
     change the real user ID; likewise if EUID is `-1', it means not to
     change the effective user ID.

     The `setreuid' function exists for compatibility with 4.3 BSD Unix,
     which does not support file IDs.  You can use this function to
     swap the effective and real user IDs of the process.  (Privileged
     processes are not limited to this particular usage.)  If file IDs
     are supported, you should use that feature instead of this
     function.  *Note Enable/Disable Setuid::.

     The return value is `0' on success and `-1' on failure.  The
     following `errno' error conditions are defined for this function:

    `EPERM'
          The process does not have the appropriate privileges; you do
          not have permission to change to the specified ID.


File: libc.info,  Node: Setting Groups,  Next: Enable/Disable Setuid,  Prev: Setting User ID,  Up: Users and Groups

30.7 Setting the Group IDs
==========================

This section describes the functions for altering the group IDs (real
and effective) of a process.  To use these facilities, you must include
the header files `sys/types.h' and `unistd.h'.  

 -- Function: int setegid (gid_t NEWGID)
     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Unsafe lock | AC-Unsafe lock | *Note
     POSIX Safety Concepts::.

     This function sets the effective group ID of the process to
     NEWGID, provided that the process is allowed to change its group
     ID.  Just as with `seteuid', if the process is privileged it may
     change its effective group ID to any value; if it isn't, but it
     has a file group ID, then it may change to its real group ID or
     file group ID; otherwise it may not change its effective group ID.

     Note that a process is only privileged if its effective _user_ ID
     is zero.  The effective group ID only affects access permissions.

     The return values and error conditions for `setegid' are the same
     as those for `seteuid'.

     This function is only present if `_POSIX_SAVED_IDS' is defined.

 -- Function: int setgid (gid_t NEWGID)
     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Unsafe lock | AC-Unsafe lock | *Note
     POSIX Safety Concepts::.

     This function sets both the real and effective group ID of the
     process to NEWGID, provided that the process is privileged.  It
     also deletes the file group ID, if any.

     If the process is not privileged, then `setgid' behaves like
     `setegid'.

     The return values and error conditions for `setgid' are the same
     as those for `seteuid'.

 -- Function: int setregid (gid_t RGID, gid_t EGID)
     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Unsafe lock | AC-Unsafe lock | *Note
     POSIX Safety Concepts::.

     This function sets the real group ID of the process to RGID and
     the effective group ID to EGID.  If RGID is `-1', it means not to
     change the real group ID; likewise if EGID is `-1', it means not
     to change the effective group ID.

     The `setregid' function is provided for compatibility with 4.3 BSD
     Unix, which does not support file IDs.  You can use this function
     to swap the effective and real group IDs of the process.
     (Privileged processes are not limited to this usage.)  If file IDs
     are supported, you should use that feature instead of using this
     function.  *Note Enable/Disable Setuid::.

     The return values and error conditions for `setregid' are the same
     as those for `setreuid'.

   `setuid' and `setgid' behave differently depending on whether the
effective user ID at the time is zero.  If it is not zero, they behave
like `seteuid' and `setegid'.  If it is, they change both effective and
real IDs and delete the file ID.  To avoid confusion, we recommend you
always use `seteuid' and `setegid' except when you know the effective
user ID is zero and your intent is to change the persona permanently.
This case is rare--most of the programs that need it, such as `login'
and `su', have already been written.

   Note that if your program is setuid to some user other than `root',
there is no way to drop privileges permanently.

   The system also lets privileged processes change their supplementary
group IDs.  To use `setgroups' or `initgroups', your programs should
include the header file `grp.h'.  

 -- Function: int setgroups (size_t COUNT, const gid_t *GROUPS)
     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Unsafe lock | AC-Unsafe lock | *Note
     POSIX Safety Concepts::.

     This function sets the process's supplementary group IDs.  It can
     only be called from privileged processes.  The COUNT argument
     specifies the number of group IDs in the array GROUPS.

     This function returns `0' if successful and `-1' on error.  The
     following `errno' error conditions are defined for this function:

    `EPERM'
          The calling process is not privileged.

 -- Function: int initgroups (const char *USER, gid_t GROUP)
     Preliminary: | MT-Safe locale | AS-Unsafe dlopen plugin heap lock
     | AC-Unsafe corrupt mem fd lock | *Note POSIX Safety Concepts::.

     The `initgroups' function sets the process's supplementary group
     IDs to be the normal default for the user name USER.  The group
     GROUP is automatically included.

     This function works by scanning the group database for all the
     groups USER belongs to.  It then calls `setgroups' with the list it
     has constructed.

     The return values and error conditions are the same as for
     `setgroups'.

   If you are interested in the groups a particular user belongs to,
but do not want to change the process's supplementary group IDs, you
can use `getgrouplist'.  To use `getgrouplist', your programs should
include the header file `grp.h'.  

 -- Function: int getgrouplist (const char *USER, gid_t GROUP, gid_t
          *GROUPS, int *NGROUPS)
     Preliminary: | MT-Safe locale | AS-Unsafe dlopen plugin heap lock
     | AC-Unsafe corrupt mem fd lock | *Note POSIX Safety Concepts::.

     The `getgrouplist' function scans the group database for all the
     groups USER belongs to.  Up to *NGROUPS group IDs corresponding to
     these groups are stored in the array GROUPS; the return value from
     the function is the number of group IDs actually stored.  If
     *NGROUPS is smaller than the total number of groups found, then
     `getgrouplist' returns a value of `-1' and stores the actual
     number of groups in *NGROUPS.  The group GROUP is automatically
     included in the list of groups returned by `getgrouplist'.

     Here's how to use `getgrouplist' to read all supplementary groups
     for USER:

          gid_t *
          supplementary_groups (char *user)
          {
            int ngroups = 16;
            gid_t *groups
              = (gid_t *) xmalloc (ngroups * sizeof (gid_t));
            struct passwd *pw = getpwnam (user);

            if (pw == NULL)
              return NULL;

            if (getgrouplist (pw->pw_name, pw->pw_gid, groups, &ngroups) < 0)
              {
                groups = xrealloc (ngroups * sizeof (gid_t));
                getgrouplist (pw->pw_name, pw->pw_gid, groups, &ngroups);
              }
            return groups;
          }

30.8 Enabling and Disabling Setuid Access
=========================================

A typical setuid program does not need its special access all of the
time.  It's a good idea to turn off this access when it isn't needed,
so it can't possibly give unintended access.

   If the system supports the `_POSIX_SAVED_IDS' feature, you can
accomplish this with `seteuid'.  When the game program starts, its real
user ID is `jdoe', its effective user ID is `games', and its saved user
ID is also `games'.  The program should record both user ID values once
at the beginning, like this:

     user_user_id = getuid ();
     game_user_id = geteuid ();

   Then it can turn off game file access with

     seteuid (user_user_id);

and turn it on with

     seteuid (game_user_id);

Throughout this process, the real user ID remains `jdoe' and the file
user ID remains `games', so the program can always set its effective
user ID to either one.

   On other systems that don't support file user IDs, you can turn
setuid access on and off by using `setreuid' to swap the real and
effective user IDs of the process, as follows:

     setreuid (geteuid (), getuid ());

This special case is always allowed--it cannot fail.

   Why does this have the effect of toggling the setuid access?
Suppose a game program has just started, and its real user ID is `jdoe'
while its effective user ID is `games'.  In this state, the game can
write the scores file.  If it swaps the two uids, the real becomes
`games' and the effective becomes `jdoe'; now the program has only
`jdoe' access.  Another swap brings `games' back to the effective user
ID and restores access to the scores file.

   In order to handle both kinds of systems, test for the saved user ID
feature with a preprocessor conditional, like this:

     #ifdef _POSIX_SAVED_IDS
       seteuid (user_user_id);
     #else
       setreuid (geteuid (), getuid ());
     #endif

30.9 Setuid Program Example
===========================

Here's an example showing how to set up a program that changes its
effective user ID.

   This is part of a game program called `caber-toss' that manipulates
a file `scores' that should be writable only by the game program
itself.  The program assumes that its executable file will be installed
with the setuid bit set and owned by the same user as the `scores'
file.  Typically, a system administrator will set up an account like
`games' for this purpose.

   The executable file is given mode `4755', so that doing an `ls -l'
on it produces output like:

     -rwsr-xr-x   1 games    184422 Jul 30 15:17 caber-toss

The setuid bit shows up in the file modes as the `s'.

   The scores file is given mode `644', and doing an `ls -l' on it
shows:

     -rw-r--r--  1 games           0 Jul 31 15:33 scores

   Here are the parts of the program that show how to set up the changed
user ID.  This program is conditionalized so that it makes use of the
file IDs feature if it is supported, and otherwise uses `setreuid' to
swap the effective and real user IDs.

     #include <stdio.h>
     #include <sys/types.h>
     #include <unistd.h>
     #include <stdlib.h>


     /* Remember the effective and real UIDs. */

     static uid_t euid, ruid;


     /* Restore the effective UID to its original value. */

     void
     do_setuid (void)
     {
       int status;

     #ifdef _POSIX_SAVED_IDS
       status = seteuid (euid);
     #else
       status = setreuid (ruid, euid);
     #endif
       if (status < 0) {
         fprintf (stderr, "Couldn't set uid.\n");
         exit (status);
         }
     }


     /* Set the effective UID to the real UID. */

     void
     undo_setuid (void)
     {
       int status;

     #ifdef _POSIX_SAVED_IDS
       status = seteuid (ruid);
     #else
       status = setreuid (euid, ruid);
     #endif
       if (status < 0) {
         fprintf (stderr, "Couldn't set uid.\n");
         exit (status);
         }
     }

     /* Main program. */

     int
     main (void)
     {
       /* Remember the real and effective user IDs.  */
       ruid = getuid ();
       euid = geteuid ();
       undo_setuid ();

       /* Do the game and record the score.  */
       ...
     }

   Notice how the first thing the `main' function does is to set the
effective user ID back to the real user ID.  This is so that any other
file accesses that are performed while the user is playing the game use
the real user ID for determining permissions.  Only when the program
needs to open the scores file does it switch back to the file user ID,
like this:

     /* Record the score. */

     int
     record_score (int score)
     {
       FILE *stream;
       char *myname;

       /* Open the scores file. */
       do_setuid ();
       stream = fopen (SCORES_FILE, "a");
       undo_setuid ();

       /* Write the score to the file. */
       if (stream)
         {
           myname = cuserid (NULL);
           if (score < 0)
             fprintf (stream, "%10s: Couldn't lift the caber.\n", myname);
           else
             fprintf (stream, "%10s: %d feet.\n", myname, score);
           fclose (stream);
           return 0;
         }
       else
         return -1;
     }

30.10 Tips for Writing Setuid Programs
======================================

It is easy for setuid programs to give the user access that isn't
intended--in fact, if you want to avoid this, you need to be careful.
Here are some guidelines for preventing unintended access and
minimizing its consequences when it does occur:

   * Don't have `setuid' programs with privileged user IDs such as
     `root' unless it is absolutely necessary.  If the resource is
     specific to your particular program, it's better to define a new,
     nonprivileged user ID or group ID just to manage that resource.
     It's better if you can write your program to use a special group
     than a special user.

   * Be cautious about using the `exec' functions in combination with
     changing the effective user ID.  Don't let users of your program
     execute arbitrary programs under a changed user ID.  Executing a
     shell is especially bad news.  Less obviously, the `execlp' and
     `execvp' functions are a potential risk (since the program they
     execute depends on the user's `PATH' environment variable).

     If you must `exec' another program under a changed ID, specify an
     absolute file name (*note File Name Resolution::) for the
     executable, and make sure that the protections on that executable
     and _all_ containing directories are such that ordinary users
     cannot replace it with some other program.

     You should also check the arguments passed to the program to make
     sure they do not have unexpected effects.  Likewise, you should
     examine the environment variables.  Decide which arguments and
     variables are safe, and reject all others.

     You should never use `system' in a privileged program, because it
     invokes a shell.

   * Only use the user ID controlling the resource in the part of the
     program that actually uses that resource.  When you're finished
     with it, restore the effective user ID back to the actual user's
     user ID.  *Note Enable/Disable Setuid::.

   * If the `setuid' part of your program needs to access other files
     besides the controlled resource, it should verify that the real
     user would ordinarily have permission to access those files.  You
     can use the `access' function (*note Access Permission::) to check
     this; it uses the real user and group IDs, rather than the
     effective IDs.


File: libc.info,  Node: Who Logged In,  Next: User Accounting Database,  Prev: Tips for Setuid,  Up: Users and Groups

30.11 Identifying Who Logged In
===============================

You can use the functions listed in this section to determine the login
name of the user who is running a process, and the name of the user who
logged in the current session.  See also the function `getuid' and
friends (*note Reading Persona::).  How this information is collected by
the system and how to control/add/remove information from the background
storage is described in *Note User Accounting Database::.

   The `getlogin' function is declared in `unistd.h', while `cuserid'
and `L_cuserid' are declared in `stdio.h'.  

 -- Function: char * getlogin (void)
     Preliminary: | MT-Unsafe race:getlogin race:utent sig:ALRM timer
     locale | AS-Unsafe dlopen plugin heap lock | AC-Unsafe corrupt
     lock fd mem | *Note POSIX Safety Concepts::.

     The `getlogin' function returns a pointer to a string containing
     the name of the user logged in on the controlling terminal of the
     process, or a null pointer if this information cannot be
     determined.  The string is statically allocated and might be
     overwritten on subsequent calls to this function or to `cuserid'.

 -- Function: char * cuserid (char *STRING)
     Preliminary: | MT-Unsafe race:cuserid/!string locale | AS-Unsafe
     dlopen plugin heap lock | AC-Unsafe corrupt lock fd mem | *Note
     POSIX Safety Concepts::.

     The `cuserid' function returns a pointer to a string containing a
     user name associated with the effective ID of the process.  If
     STRING is not a null pointer, it should be an array that can hold
     at least `L_cuserid' characters; the string is returned in this
     array.  Otherwise, a pointer to a string in a static area is
     returned.  This string is statically allocated and might be
     overwritten on subsequent calls to this function or to `getlogin'.

     The use of this function is deprecated since it is marked to be
     withdrawn in XPG4.2 and has already been removed from newer
     revisions of POSIX.1.

 -- Macro: int L_cuserid
     An integer constant that indicates how long an array you might
     need to store a user name.

   These functions let your program identify positively the user who is
running or the user who logged in this session.  (These can differ when
setuid programs are involved; see *Note Process Persona::.)  The user
cannot do anything to fool these functions.

   For most purposes, it is more useful to use the environment variable
`LOGNAME' to find out who the user is.  This is more flexible precisely
because the user can set `LOGNAME' arbitrarily.  *Note Standard
Environment::.

30.12 The User Accounting Database
==================================

Most Unix-like operating systems keep track of logged in users by
maintaining a user accounting database.  This user accounting database
stores for each terminal, who has logged on, at what time, the process
ID of the user's login shell, etc., etc., but also stores information
about the run level of the system, the time of the last system reboot,
and possibly more.

   The user accounting database typically lives in `/etc/utmp',
`/var/adm/utmp' or `/var/run/utmp'.  However, these files should
*never* be accessed directly.  For reading information from and writing
information to the user accounting database, the functions described in
this section should be used.

* Menu:

* Manipulating the Database::   Scanning and modifying the user
                                 accounting database.
* XPG Functions::               A standardized way for doing the same thing.
* Logging In and Out::          Functions from BSD that modify the user
                                 accounting database.

30.12.1 Manipulating the User Accounting Database
-------------------------------------------------

These functions and the corresponding data structures are declared in
the header file `utmp.h'.  

 -- Data Type: struct exit_status
     The `exit_status' data structure is used to hold information about
     the exit status of processes marked as `DEAD_PROCESS' in the user
     accounting database.

    `short int e_termination'
          The exit status of the process.

    `short int e_exit'
          The exit status of the process.

 -- Data Type: struct utmp
     The `utmp' data structure is used to hold information about entries
     in the user accounting database.  On GNU systems it has the
     following members:

    `short int ut_type'
          Specifies the type of login; one of `EMPTY', `RUN_LVL',
          `BOOT_TIME', `OLD_TIME', `NEW_TIME', `INIT_PROCESS',
          `LOGIN_PROCESS', `USER_PROCESS', `DEAD_PROCESS' or
          `ACCOUNTING'.

    `pid_t ut_pid'
          The process ID number of the login process.

    `char ut_line[]'
          The device name of the tty (without `/dev/').

    `char ut_id[]'
          The inittab ID of the process.

    `char ut_user[]'
          The user's login name.

    `char ut_host[]'
          The name of the host from which the user logged in.

    `struct exit_status ut_exit'
          The exit status of a process marked as `DEAD_PROCESS'.

    `long ut_session'
          The Session ID, used for windowing.

    `struct timeval ut_tv'
          Time the entry was made.  For entries of type `OLD_TIME' this
          is the time when the system clock changed, and for entries of
          type `NEW_TIME' this is the time the system clock was set to.

    `int32_t ut_addr_v6[4]'
          The Internet address of a remote host.

   The `ut_type', `ut_pid', `ut_id', `ut_tv', and `ut_host' fields are
not available on all systems.  Portable applications therefore should
be prepared for these situations.  To help do this the `utmp.h' header
provides macros `_HAVE_UT_TYPE', `_HAVE_UT_PID', `_HAVE_UT_ID',
`_HAVE_UT_TV', and `_HAVE_UT_HOST' if the respective field is
available.  The programmer can handle the situations by using `#ifdef'
in the program code.

   The following macros are defined for use as values for the `ut_type'
member of the `utmp' structure.  The values are integer constants.

`EMPTY'
     This macro is used to indicate that the entry contains no valid
     user accounting information.

`RUN_LVL'
     This macro is used to identify the system's runlevel.

`BOOT_TIME'
     This macro is used to identify the time of system boot.

`OLD_TIME'
     This macro is used to identify the time when the system clock
     changed.

`NEW_TIME'
     This macro is used to identify the time after the system clock
     changed.

`INIT_PROCESS'
     This macro is used to identify a process spawned by the init
     process.

`LOGIN_PROCESS'
     This macro is used to identify the session leader of a logged in
     user.

`USER_PROCESS'
     This macro is used to identify a user process.

`DEAD_PROCESS'
     This macro is used to identify a terminated process.

`ACCOUNTING'
     ???

   The size of the `ut_line', `ut_id', `ut_user' and `ut_host' arrays
can be found using the `sizeof' operator.

   Many older systems have, instead of an `ut_tv' member, an `ut_time'
member, usually of type `time_t', for representing the time associated
with the entry.  Therefore, for backwards compatibility only, `utmp.h'
defines `ut_time' as an alias for `ut_tv.tv_sec'.

 -- Function: void setutent (void)
     Preliminary: | MT-Unsafe race:utent | AS-Unsafe lock | AC-Unsafe
     lock fd | *Note POSIX Safety Concepts::.

     This function opens the user accounting database to begin scanning
     it.  You can then call `getutent', `getutid' or `getutline' to
     read entries and `pututline' to write entries.

     If the database is already open, it resets the input to the
     beginning of the database.

 -- Function: struct utmp * getutent (void)
     Preliminary: | MT-Unsafe init race:utent race:utentbuf sig:ALRM
     timer | AS-Unsafe heap lock | AC-Unsafe lock fd mem | *Note POSIX
     Safety Concepts::.

     The `getutent' function reads the next entry from the user
     accounting database.  It returns a pointer to the entry, which is
     statically allocated and may be overwritten by subsequent calls to
     `getutent'.  You must copy the contents of the structure if you
     wish to save the information or you can use the `getutent_r'
     function which stores the data in a user-provided buffer.

     A null pointer is returned in case no further entry is available.

 -- Function: void endutent (void)
     Preliminary: | MT-Unsafe race:utent | AS-Unsafe lock | AC-Unsafe
     lock fd | *Note POSIX Safety Concepts::.

     This function closes the user accounting database.

 -- Function: struct utmp * getutid (const struct utmp *ID)
     Preliminary: | MT-Unsafe init race:utent sig:ALRM timer |
     AS-Unsafe lock heap | AC-Unsafe lock mem fd | *Note POSIX Safety
     Concepts::.

     This function searches forward from the current point in the
     database for an entry that matches ID.  If the `ut_type' member of
     the ID structure is one of `RUN_LVL', `BOOT_TIME', `OLD_TIME' or
     `NEW_TIME' the entries match if the `ut_type' members are
     identical.  If the `ut_type' member of the ID structure is
     `INIT_PROCESS', `LOGIN_PROCESS', `USER_PROCESS' or `DEAD_PROCESS',
     the entries match if the `ut_type' member of the entry read from
     the database is one of these four, and the `ut_id' members match.
     However if the `ut_id' member of either the ID structure or the
     entry read from the database is empty it checks if the `ut_line'
     members match instead.  If a matching entry is found, `getutid'
     returns a pointer to the entry, which is statically allocated, and
     may be overwritten by a subsequent call to `getutent', `getutid'
     or `getutline'.  You must copy the contents of the structure if
     you wish to save the information.

     A null pointer is returned in case the end of the database is
     reached without a match.

     The `getutid' function may cache the last read entry.  Therefore,
     if you are using `getutid' to search for multiple occurrences, it
     is necessary to zero out the static data after each call.
     Otherwise `getutid' could just return a pointer to the same entry
     over and over again.

 -- Function: struct utmp * getutline (const struct utmp *LINE)
     Preliminary: | MT-Unsafe init race:utent sig:ALRM timer |
     AS-Unsafe heap lock | AC-Unsafe lock fd mem | *Note POSIX Safety
     Concepts::.

     This function searches forward from the current point in the
     database until it finds an entry whose `ut_type' value is
     `LOGIN_PROCESS' or `USER_PROCESS', and whose `ut_line' member
     matches the `ut_line' member of the LINE structure.  If it finds
     such an entry, it returns a pointer to the entry which is
     statically allocated, and may be overwritten by a subsequent call
     to `getutent', `getutid' or `getutline'.  You must copy the
     contents of the structure if you wish to save the information.

     A null pointer is returned in case the end of the database is
     reached without a match.

     The `getutline' function may cache the last read entry.  Therefore
     if you are using `getutline' to search for multiple occurrences, it
     is necessary to zero out the static data after each call.
     Otherwise `getutline' could just return a pointer to the same
     entry over and over again.

 -- Function: struct utmp * pututline (const struct utmp *UTMP)
     Preliminary: | MT-Unsafe race:utent sig:ALRM timer | AS-Unsafe lock
     | AC-Unsafe lock fd | *Note POSIX Safety Concepts::.

     The `pututline' function inserts the entry `*UTMP' at the
     appropriate place in the user accounting database.  If it finds
     that it is not already at the correct place in the database, it
     uses `getutid' to search for the position to insert the entry,
     however this will not modify the static structure returned by
     `getutent', `getutid' and `getutline'.  If this search fails, the
     entry is appended to the database.

     The `pututline' function returns a pointer to a copy of the entry
     inserted in the user accounting database, or a null pointer if the
     entry could not be added.  The following `errno' error conditions
     are defined for this function:

    `EPERM'
          The process does not have the appropriate privileges; you
          cannot modify the user accounting database.

   All the `get*' functions mentioned before store the information they
return in a static buffer.  This can be a problem in multi-threaded
programs since the data returned for the request is overwritten by the
return value data in another thread.  Therefore the GNU C Library
provides as extensions three more functions which return the data in a
user-provided buffer.

 -- Function: int getutent_r (struct utmp *BUFFER, struct utmp **RESULT)
     Preliminary: | MT-Unsafe race:utent sig:ALRM timer | AS-Unsafe lock
     | AC-Unsafe lock fd | *Note POSIX Safety Concepts::.

     The `getutent_r' is equivalent to the `getutent' function.  It
     returns the next entry from the database.  But instead of storing
     the information in a static buffer it stores it in the buffer
     pointed to by the parameter BUFFER.

     If the call was successful, the function returns `0' and the
     pointer variable pointed to by the parameter RESULT contains a
     pointer to the buffer which contains the result (this is most
     probably the same value as BUFFER).  If something went wrong
     during the execution of `getutent_r' the function returns `-1'.

     This function is a GNU extension.

 -- Function: int getutid_r (const struct utmp *ID, struct utmp
          *BUFFER, struct utmp **RESULT)
     Preliminary: | MT-Unsafe race:utent sig:ALRM timer | AS-Unsafe lock
     | AC-Unsafe lock fd | *Note POSIX Safety Concepts::.

     This function retrieves just like `getutid' the next entry matching
     the information stored in ID.  But the result is stored in the
     buffer pointed to by the parameter BUFFER.

     If successful the function returns `0' and the pointer variable
     pointed to by the parameter RESULT contains a pointer to the
     buffer with the result (probably the same as RESULT.  If not
     successful the function return `-1'.

     This function is a GNU extension.

 -- Function: int getutline_r (const struct utmp *LINE, struct utmp
          *BUFFER, struct utmp **RESULT)
     Preliminary: | MT-Unsafe race:utent sig:ALRM timer | AS-Unsafe lock
     | AC-Unsafe lock fd | *Note POSIX Safety Concepts::.

     This function retrieves just like `getutline' the next entry
     matching the information stored in LINE.  But the result is stored
     in the buffer pointed to by the parameter BUFFER.

     If successful the function returns `0' and the pointer variable
     pointed to by the parameter RESULT contains a pointer to the
     buffer with the result (probably the same as RESULT.  If not
     successful the function return `-1'.

     This function is a GNU extension.

   In addition to the user accounting database, most systems keep a
number of similar databases.  For example most systems keep a log file
with all previous logins (usually in `/etc/wtmp' or `/var/log/wtmp').

   For specifying which database to examine, the following function
should be used.

 -- Function: int utmpname (const char *FILE)
     Preliminary: | MT-Unsafe race:utent | AS-Unsafe lock heap |
     AC-Unsafe lock mem | *Note POSIX Safety Concepts::.

     The `utmpname' function changes the name of the database to be
     examined to FILE, and closes any previously opened database.  By
     default `getutent', `getutid', `getutline' and `pututline' read
     from and write to the user accounting database.

     The following macros are defined for use as the FILE argument:

      -- Macro: char * _PATH_UTMP
          This macro is used to specify the user accounting database.

      -- Macro: char * _PATH_WTMP
          This macro is used to specify the user accounting log file.

     The `utmpname' function returns a value of `0' if the new name was
     successfully stored, and a value of `-1' to indicate an error.
     Note that `utmpname' does not try to open the database, and that
     therefore the return value does not say anything about whether the
     database can be successfully opened.

   Specially for maintaining log-like databases the GNU C Library
provides the following function:

 -- Function: void updwtmp (const char *WTMP_FILE, const struct utmp
          *UTMP)
     Preliminary: | MT-Unsafe sig:ALRM timer | AS-Unsafe | AC-Unsafe fd
     | *Note POSIX Safety Concepts::.

     The `updwtmp' function appends the entry *UTMP to the database
     specified by WTMP_FILE.  For possible values for the WTMP_FILE
     argument see the `utmpname' function.

   *Portability Note:* Although many operating systems provide a subset
of these functions, they are not standardized.  There are often subtle
differences in the return types, and there are considerable differences
between the various definitions of `struct utmp'.  When programming for
the GNU C Library, it is probably best to stick with the functions
described in this section.  If however, you want your program to be
portable, consider using the XPG functions described in *Note XPG
Functions::, or take a look at the BSD compatible functions in *Note
Logging In and Out::.

30.12.2 XPG User Accounting Database Functions
----------------------------------------------

These functions, described in the X/Open Portability Guide, are declared
in the header file `utmpx.h'.  

 -- Data Type: struct utmpx
     The `utmpx' data structure contains at least the following members:

    `short int ut_type'
          Specifies the type of login; one of `EMPTY', `RUN_LVL',
          `BOOT_TIME', `OLD_TIME', `NEW_TIME', `INIT_PROCESS',
          `LOGIN_PROCESS', `USER_PROCESS' or `DEAD_PROCESS'.

    `pid_t ut_pid'
          The process ID number of the login process.

    `char ut_line[]'
          The device name of the tty (without `/dev/').

    `char ut_id[]'
          The inittab ID of the process.

    `char ut_user[]'
          The user's login name.

    `struct timeval ut_tv'
          Time the entry was made.  For entries of type `OLD_TIME' this
          is the time when the system clock changed, and for entries of
          type `NEW_TIME' this is the time the system clock was set to.
     In the GNU C Library, `struct utmpx' is identical to `struct utmp'
     except for the fact that including `utmpx.h' does not make visible
     the declaration of `struct exit_status'.

   The following macros are defined for use as values for the `ut_type'
member of the `utmpx' structure.  The values are integer constants and
are, in the GNU C Library, identical to the definitions in `utmp.h'.

`EMPTY'
     This macro is used to indicate that the entry contains no valid
     user accounting information.

`RUN_LVL'
     This macro is used to identify the system's runlevel.

`BOOT_TIME'

30.12.3 Logging In and Out
--------------------------

These functions, derived from BSD, are available in the separate
`libutil' library, and declared in `utmp.h'.  

   Note that the `ut_user' member of `struct utmp' is called `ut_name'
in BSD.  Therefore, `ut_name' is defined as an alias for `ut_user' in
`utmp.h'.

 -- Function: int login_tty (int FILEDES)
     Preliminary: | MT-Unsafe race:ttyname | AS-Unsafe heap lock |
     AC-Unsafe lock fd mem | *Note POSIX Safety Concepts::.

     This function makes FILEDES the controlling terminal of the
     current process, redirects standard input, standard output and
     standard error output to this terminal, and closes FILEDES.

     This function returns `0' on successful completion, and `-1' on
     error.

 -- Function: void login (const struct utmp *ENTRY)
     Preliminary: | MT-Unsafe race:utent sig:ALRM timer | AS-Unsafe
     lock heap | AC-Unsafe lock corrupt fd mem | *Note POSIX Safety
     Concepts::.

     The `login' functions inserts an entry into the user accounting
     database.  The `ut_line' member is set to the name of the terminal
     on standard input.  If standard input is not a terminal `login'
     uses standard output or standard error output to determine the
     name of the terminal.  If `struct utmp' has a `ut_type' member,
     `login' sets it to `USER_PROCESS', and if there is an `ut_pid'
     member, it will be set to the process ID of the current process.
     The remaining entries are copied from ENTRY.

     A copy of the entry is written to the user accounting log file.

 -- Function: int logout (const char *UT_LINE)
     Preliminary: | MT-Unsafe race:utent sig:ALRM timer | AS-Unsafe
     lock heap | AC-Unsafe lock fd mem | *Note POSIX Safety Concepts::.

     This function modifies the user accounting database to indicate
     that the user on UT_LINE has logged out.

     The `logout' function returns `1' if the entry was successfully
     written to the database, or `0' on error.

 -- Function: void logwtmp (const char *UT_LINE, const char *UT_NAME,
          const char *UT_HOST)
     Preliminary: | MT-Unsafe sig:ALRM timer | AS-Unsafe | AC-Unsafe fd
     | *Note POSIX Safety Concepts::.

     The `logwtmp' function appends an entry to the user accounting log
     file, for the current time and the information provided in the
     UT_LINE, UT_NAME and UT_HOST arguments.

   *Portability Note:* The BSD `struct utmp' only has the `ut_line',
`ut_name', `ut_host' and `ut_time' members.  Older systems do not even
have the `ut_host' member.

30.13.1 The Data Structure that Describes a User
------------------------------------------------

The functions and data structures for accessing the system user database
are declared in the header file `pwd.h'.  

 -- Data Type: struct passwd
     The `passwd' data structure is used to hold information about
     entries in the system user data base.  It has at least the
     following members:

    `char *pw_name'
          The user's login name.

    `char *pw_passwd.'
          The encrypted password string.

    `uid_t pw_uid'
          The user ID number.

    `gid_t pw_gid'
          The user's default group ID number.

    `char *pw_gecos'
          A string typically containing the user's real name, and
          possibly other information such as a phone number.

    `char *pw_dir'
          The user's home directory, or initial working directory.
          This might be a null pointer, in which case the
          interpretation is system-dependent.

    `char *pw_shell'
          The user's default shell, or the initial program run when the
          user logs in.  This might be a null pointer, indicating that
          the system default should be used.


File: libc.info,  Node: Lookup User,  Next: Scanning All Users,  Prev: User Data Structure,  Up: User Database

30.13.2 Looking Up One User
---------------------------

You can search the system user database for information about a
specific user using `getpwuid' or `getpwnam'.  These functions are
declared in `pwd.h'.

 -- Function: struct passwd * getpwuid (uid_t UID)
     Preliminary: | MT-Unsafe race:pwuid locale | AS-Unsafe dlopen
     plugin heap lock | AC-Unsafe corrupt lock fd mem | *Note POSIX
     Safety Concepts::.

     This function returns a pointer to a statically-allocated structure
     containing information about the user whose user ID is UID.  This
     structure may be overwritten on subsequent calls to `getpwuid'.

     A null pointer value indicates there is no user in the data base
     with user ID UID.

 -- Function: int getpwuid_r (uid_t UID, struct passwd *RESULT_BUF,
          char *BUFFER, size_t BUFLEN, struct passwd **RESULT)
     Preliminary: | MT-Safe locale | AS-Unsafe dlopen plugin heap lock
     | AC-Unsafe corrupt lock fd mem | *Note POSIX Safety Concepts::.

     This function is similar to `getpwuid' in that it returns
     information about the user whose user ID is UID.  However, it
     fills the user supplied structure pointed to by RESULT_BUF with
     the information instead of using a static buffer.  The first
     BUFLEN bytes of the additional buffer pointed to by BUFFER are
     used to contain additional information, normally strings which are
     pointed to by the elements of the result structure.

     If a user with ID UID is found, the pointer returned in RESULT
     points to the record which contains the wanted data (i.e., RESULT
     contains the value RESULT_BUF).  If no user is found or if an
     error occurred, the pointer returned in RESULT is a null pointer.
     The function returns zero or an error code.  If the buffer BUFFER
     is too small to contain all the needed information, the error code
     `ERANGE' is returned and ERRNO is set to `ERANGE'.

 -- Function: struct passwd * getpwnam (const char *NAME)
     Preliminary: | MT-Unsafe race:pwnam locale | AS-Unsafe dlopen
     plugin heap lock | AC-Unsafe corrupt lock fd mem | *Note POSIX
     Safety Concepts::.

     This function returns a pointer to a statically-allocated structure
     containing information about the user whose user name is NAME.
     This structure may be overwritten on subsequent calls to
     `getpwnam'.

     A null pointer return indicates there is no user named NAME.

 -- Function: int getpwnam_r (const char *NAME, struct passwd
          *RESULT_BUF, char *BUFFER, size_t BUFLEN, struct passwd
          **RESULT)
     Preliminary: | MT-Safe locale | AS-Unsafe dlopen plugin heap lock
     | AC-Unsafe corrupt lock fd mem | *Note POSIX Safety Concepts::.

     This function is similar to `getpwnam' in that it returns
     information about the user whose user name is NAME.  However, like
     `getpwuid_r', it fills the user supplied buffers in RESULT_BUF and
     BUFFER with the information instead of using a static buffer.

     The return values are the same as for `getpwuid_r'.

30.13.3 Scanning the List of All Users
--------------------------------------

This section explains how a program can read the list of all users in
the system, one user at a time.  The functions described here are
declared in `pwd.h'.

   You can use the `fgetpwent' function to read user entries from a
particular file.

 -- Function: struct passwd * fgetpwent (FILE *STREAM)
     Preliminary: | MT-Unsafe race:fpwent | AS-Unsafe corrupt lock |
     AC-Unsafe corrupt lock | *Note POSIX Safety Concepts::.

     This function reads the next user entry from STREAM and returns a
     pointer to the entry.  The structure is statically allocated and is
     rewritten on subsequent calls to `fgetpwent'.  You must copy the
     contents of the structure if you wish to save the information.

     The stream must correspond to a file in the same format as the
     standard password database file.

 -- Function: int fgetpwent_r (FILE *STREAM, struct passwd *RESULT_BUF,
          char *BUFFER, size_t BUFLEN, struct passwd **RESULT)
     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Unsafe corrupt | AC-Unsafe corrupt lock
     | *Note POSIX Safety Concepts::.

     This function is similar to `fgetpwent' in that it reads the next
     user entry from STREAM.  But the result is returned in the
     structure pointed to by RESULT_BUF.  The first BUFLEN bytes of the
     additional buffer pointed to by BUFFER are used to contain
     additional information, normally strings which are pointed to by
     the elements of the result structure.

     The stream must correspond to a file in the same format as the
     standard password database file.

     If the function returns zero RESULT points to the structure with
     the wanted data (normally this is in RESULT_BUF).  If errors
     occurred the return value is nonzero and RESULT contains a null
     pointer.

   The way to scan all the entries in the user database is with
`setpwent', `getpwent', and `endpwent'.

 -- Function: void setpwent (void)
     Preliminary: | MT-Unsafe race:pwent locale | AS-Unsafe dlopen
     plugin heap lock | AC-Unsafe corrupt lock fd mem | *Note POSIX
     Safety Concepts::.

     This function initializes a stream which `getpwent' and
     `getpwent_r' use to read the user database.

 -- Function: struct passwd * getpwent (void)
     Preliminary: | MT-Unsafe race:pwent race:pwentbuf locale |
     AS-Unsafe dlopen plugin heap lock | AC-Unsafe corrupt lock fd mem
     | *Note POSIX Safety Concepts::.

     The `getpwent' function reads the next entry from the stream
     initialized by `setpwent'.  It returns a pointer to the entry.  The
     structure is statically allocated and is rewritten on subsequent
     calls to `getpwent'.  You must copy the contents of the structure
     if you wish to save the information.

     A null pointer is returned when no more entries are available.

 -- Function: int getpwent_r (struct passwd *RESULT_BUF, char *BUFFER,
          size_t BUFLEN, struct passwd **RESULT)
     Preliminary: | MT-Unsafe race:pwent locale | AS-Unsafe dlopen
     plugin heap lock | AC-Unsafe corrupt lock fd mem | *Note POSIX
     Safety Concepts::.

     This function is similar to `getpwent' in that it returns the next
     entry from the stream initialized by `setpwent'.  Like
     `fgetpwent_r', it uses the user-supplied buffers in RESULT_BUF and
     BUFFER to return the information requested.

     The return values are the same as for `fgetpwent_r'.


 -- Function: void endpwent (void)
     Preliminary: | MT-Unsafe race:pwent locale | AS-Unsafe dlopen
     plugin heap lock | AC-Unsafe corrupt lock fd mem | *Note POSIX
     Safety Concepts::.

     This function closes the internal stream used by `getpwent' or
     `getpwent_r'.

30.13.4 Writing a User Entry
----------------------------

 -- Function: int putpwent (const struct passwd *P, FILE *STREAM)
     Preliminary: | MT-Safe locale | AS-Unsafe corrupt | AC-Unsafe lock
     corrupt | *Note POSIX Safety Concepts::.

     This function writes the user entry `*P' to the stream STREAM, in
     the format used for the standard user database file.  The return
     value is zero on success and nonzero on failure.

     This function exists for compatibility with SVID.  We recommend
     that you avoid using it, because it makes sense only on the
     assumption that the `struct passwd' structure has no members
     except the standard ones; on a system which merges the traditional
     Unix data base with other extended information about users, adding
     an entry using this function would inevitably leave out much of
     the important information.

     The group and user ID fields are left empty if the group or user
     name starts with a - or +.

     The function `putpwent' is declared in `pwd.h'.

database are declared in the header file `grp.h'.  

 -- Data Type: struct group
     The `group' structure is used to hold information about an entry in
     the system group database.  It has at least the following members:

    `char *gr_name'
          The name of the group.

    `gid_t gr_gid'
          The group ID of the group.

    `char **gr_mem'
          A vector of pointers to the names of users in the group.
          Each user name is a null-terminated string, and the vector
          itself is terminated by a null pointer.

30.14.2 Looking Up One Group
----------------------------

You can search the group database for information about a specific
group using `getgrgid' or `getgrnam'.  These functions are declared in
`grp.h'.

 -- Function: struct group * getgrgid (gid_t GID)
     Preliminary: | MT-Unsafe race:grgid locale | AS-Unsafe dlopen
     plugin heap lock | AC-Unsafe corrupt lock fd mem | *Note POSIX
     Safety Concepts::.

     This function returns a pointer to a statically-allocated structure
     containing information about the group whose group ID is GID.
     This structure may be overwritten by subsequent calls to
     `getgrgid'.

     A null pointer indicates there is no group with ID GID.

 -- Function: int getgrgid_r (gid_t GID, struct group *RESULT_BUF, char
          *BUFFER, size_t BUFLEN, struct group **RESULT)
     Preliminary: | MT-Safe locale | AS-Unsafe dlopen plugin heap lock
     | AC-Unsafe corrupt lock fd mem | *Note POSIX Safety Concepts::.

     This function is similar to `getgrgid' in that it returns
     information about the group whose group ID is GID.  However, it
     fills the user supplied structure pointed to by RESULT_BUF with
     the information instead of using a static buffer.  The first
     BUFLEN bytes of the additional buffer pointed to by BUFFER are
     used to contain additional information, normally strings which are
     pointed to by the elements of the result structure.

     If a group with ID GID is found, the pointer returned in RESULT
     points to the record which contains the wanted data (i.e., RESULT
     contains the value RESULT_BUF).  If no group is found or if an
     error occurred, the pointer returned in RESULT is a null pointer.
     The function returns zero or an error code.  If the buffer BUFFER
     is too small to contain all the needed information, the error code
     `ERANGE' is returned and ERRNO is set to `ERANGE'.

 -- Function: struct group * getgrnam (const char *NAME)
     Preliminary: | MT-Unsafe race:grnam locale | AS-Unsafe dlopen
     plugin heap lock | AC-Unsafe corrupt lock fd mem | *Note POSIX
     Safety Concepts::.

     This function returns a pointer to a statically-allocated structure
     containing information about the group whose group name is NAME.
     This structure may be overwritten by subsequent calls to
     `getgrnam'.

     A null pointer indicates there is no group named NAME.

 -- Function: int getgrnam_r (const char *NAME, struct group
          *RESULT_BUF, char *BUFFER, size_t BUFLEN, struct group
          **RESULT)
     Preliminary: | MT-Safe locale | AS-Unsafe dlopen plugin heap lock

     This function is similar to `getgrnam' in that it returns
     information about the group whose group name is NAME.  Like

   You can use the `fgetgrent' function to read group entries from a
particular file.

 -- Function: struct group * fgetgrent (FILE *STREAM)
     Preliminary: | MT-Unsafe race:fgrent | AS-Unsafe corrupt lock |
     AC-Unsafe corrupt lock | *Note POSIX Safety Concepts::.

     The `fgetgrent' function reads the next entry from STREAM.  It
     returns a pointer to the entry.  The structure is statically
     allocated and is overwritten on subsequent calls to `fgetgrent'.
     You must copy the contents of the structure if you wish to save the
     information.

     The stream must correspond to a file in the same format as the
     standard group database file.

 -- Function: int fgetgrent_r (FILE *STREAM, struct group *RESULT_BUF,
          char *BUFFER, size_t BUFLEN, struct group **RESULT)
     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Unsafe corrupt | AC-Unsafe corrupt lock
     | *Note POSIX Safety Concepts::.

     This function is similar to `fgetgrent' in that it reads the next
     user entry from STREAM.  But the result is returned in the
     structure pointed to by RESULT_BUF.  The first BUFLEN bytes of the
     additional buffer pointed to by BUFFER are used to contain
     additional information, normally strings which are pointed to by
     the elements of the result structure.

     This stream must correspond to a file in the same format as the
     standard group database file.

     If the function returns zero RESULT points to the structure with
     the wanted data (normally this is in RESULT_BUF).  If errors
     occurred the return value is non-zero and RESULT contains a null
     pointer.

   The way to scan all the entries in the group database is with
`setgrent', `getgrent', and `endgrent'.

 -- Function: void setgrent (void)
     Preliminary: | MT-Unsafe race:grent locale | AS-Unsafe dlopen
     plugin heap lock | AC-Unsafe corrupt lock fd mem | *Note POSIX
     Safety Concepts::.

     This function initializes a stream for reading from the group data
     base.  You use this stream by calling `getgrent' or `getgrent_r'.

 -- Function: struct group * getgrent (void)
     Preliminary: | MT-Unsafe race:grent race:grentbuf locale |
     AS-Unsafe dlopen plugin heap lock | AC-Unsafe corrupt lock fd mem
     | *Note POSIX Safety Concepts::.

     The `getgrent' function reads the next entry from the stream
     initialized by `setgrent'.  It returns a pointer to the entry.  The
     structure is statically allocated and is overwritten on subsequent
     calls to `getgrent'.  You must copy the contents of the structure
     if you wish to save the information.

 -- Function: int getgrent_r (struct group *RESULT_BUF, char *BUFFER,

     Preliminary: | MT-Unsafe race:grent locale | AS-Unsafe dlopen
     plugin heap lock | AC-Unsafe corrupt lock fd mem | *Note POSIX
     Safety Concepts::.

     This function is similar to `getgrent' in that it returns the next
     entry from the stream initialized by `setgrent'.  Like
     `fgetgrent_r', it places the result in user-supplied buffers
     pointed to by RESULT_BUF and BUFFER.

     If the function returns zero RESULT contains a pointer to the data
     (normally equal to RESULT_BUF).  If errors occurred the return
     value is non-zero and RESULT contains a null pointer.

inquiry functions.  The program prints some information about the user
running the program.


     #include <grp.h>
     #include <pwd.h>
     #include <sys/types.h>
     #include <unistd.h>
     #include <stdlib.h>

     int
     main (void)
     {
       uid_t me;
       struct passwd *my_passwd;
       struct group *my_group;
       char **members;

       /* Get information about the user ID. */
       me = getuid ();
       my_passwd = getpwuid (me);
       if (!my_passwd)
         {
           printf ("Couldn't find out about user %d.\n", (int) me);
           exit (EXIT_FAILURE);
         }

       /* Print the information. */
       printf ("I am %s.\n", my_passwd->pw_gecos);
       printf ("My login name is %s.\n", my_passwd->pw_name);
       printf ("My uid is %d.\n", (int) (my_passwd->pw_uid));
       printf ("My home directory is %s.\n", my_passwd->pw_dir);
       printf ("My default shell is %s.\n", my_passwd->pw_shell);

       /* Get information about the default group ID. */
       my_group = getgrgid (my_passwd->pw_gid);
       if (!my_group)
         {
           printf ("Couldn't find out about group %d.\n",
                   (int) my_passwd->pw_gid);
           exit (EXIT_FAILURE);
         }

       /* Print the information. */
       printf ("My default group is %s (%d).\n",
               my_group->gr_name, (int) (my_passwd->pw_gid));
       printf ("The members of this group are:\n");
       members = my_group->gr_mem;
       while (*members)
         {
           printf ("  %s\n", *(members));
           members++;
         }

       return EXIT_SUCCESS;
     }

   Here is some output from this program:

     I am Throckmorton Snurd.
     My login name is snurd.
     My uid is 31093.
     My home directory is /home/fsg/snurd.

30.16.1 Netgroup Data
---------------------

Sometimes it is useful to group users according to other criteria
(*note Group Database::).  E.g., it is useful to associate a certain
group of users with a certain machine.  On the other hand grouping of
host names is not supported so far.

   In Sun Microsystems' SunOS appeared a new kind of database, the
netgroup database.  It allows grouping hosts, users, and domains
freely, giving them individual names.  To be more concrete, a netgroup
is a list of triples consisting of a host name, a user name, and a
domain name where any of the entries can be a wildcard entry matching
all inputs.  A last possibility is that names of other netgroups can
also be given in the list specifying a netgroup.  So one can construct
arbitrary hierarchies without loops.

   Sun's implementation allows netgroups only for the `nis' or
`nisplus' service, *note Services in the NSS configuration::.  The
implementation in the GNU C Library has no such restriction.  An entry
in either of the input services must have the following form:

     GROUPNAME ( GROUPNAME | `('HOSTNAME`,'USERNAME`,'`domainname'`)' )+

   Any of the fields in the triple can be empty which means anything
matches.  While describing the functions we will see that the opposite
case is useful as well.  I.e., there may be entries which will not
match any input.  For entries like this, a name consisting of the single
character `-' shall be used.

30.16.2 Looking up one Netgroup
-------------------------------

The lookup functions for netgroups are a bit different than all other
system database handling functions.  Since a single netgroup can contain
many entries a two-step process is needed.  First a single netgroup is
selected and then one can iterate over all entries in this netgroup.
These functions are declared in `netdb.h'.

 -- Function: int setnetgrent (const char *NETGROUP)
     Preliminary: | MT-Unsafe race:netgrent locale | AS-Unsafe dlopen
     plugin heap lock | AC-Unsafe corrupt lock fd mem | *Note POSIX
     Safety Concepts::.

     A call to this function initializes the internal state of the
     library to allow following calls of `getnetgrent' to iterate over
     all entries in the netgroup with name NETGROUP.

     When the call is successful (i.e., when a netgroup with this name
     exists) the return value is `1'.  When the return value is `0' no
     netgroup of this name is known or some other error occurred.

   It is important to remember that there is only one single state for
iterating the netgroups.  Even if the programmer uses the
`getnetgrent_r' function the result is not really reentrant since
always only one single netgroup at a time can be processed.  If the
program needs to process more than one netgroup simultaneously she must
protect this by using external locking.  This problem was introduced in
the original netgroups implementation in SunOS and since we must stay
compatible it is not possible to change this.

   Some other functions also use the netgroups state.  Currently these
are the `innetgr' function and parts of the implementation of the
`compat' service part of the NSS implementation.

 -- Function: int getnetgrent (char **HOSTP, char **USERP, char
          **DOMAINP)
     Preliminary: | MT-Unsafe race:netgrent race:netgrentbuf locale |
     AS-Unsafe dlopen plugin heap lock | AC-Unsafe corrupt lock fd mem
     | *Note POSIX Safety Concepts::.

     This function returns the next unprocessed entry of the currently
     selected netgroup.  The string pointers, in which addresses are
     passed in the arguments HOSTP, USERP, and DOMAINP, will contain
     after a successful call pointers to appropriate strings.  If the
     string in the next entry is empty the pointer has the value `NULL'.
     The returned string pointers are only valid if none of the netgroup
     related functions are called.

     The return value is `1' if the next entry was successfully read.  A
     value of `0' means no further entries exist or internal errors
     occurred.

 -- Function: int getnetgrent_r (char **HOSTP, char **USERP, char
          **DOMAINP, char *BUFFER, size_t BUFLEN)
     Preliminary: | MT-Unsafe race:netgrent locale | AS-Unsafe dlopen
     plugin heap lock | AC-Unsafe corrupt lock fd mem | *Note POSIX
     Safety Concepts::.

     This function is similar to `getnetgrent' with only one exception:
     the strings the three string pointers HOSTP, USERP, and DOMAINP
     point to, are placed in the buffer of BUFLEN bytes starting at
     BUFFER.  This means the returned values are valid even after other
     netgroup related functions are called.

     The return value is `1' if the next entry was successfully read and
     the buffer contains enough room to place the strings in it.  `0' is
     returned in case no more entries are found, the buffer is too
     small, or internal errors occurred.

     This function is a GNU extension.  The original implementation in
     the SunOS libc does not provide this function.

 -- Function: void endnetgrent (void)
     Preliminary: | MT-Unsafe race:netgrent | AS-Unsafe dlopen plugin
     heap lock | AC-Unsafe corrupt lock fd mem | *Note POSIX Safety
     Concepts::.

     This function frees all buffers which were allocated to process
     the last selected netgroup.  As a result all string pointers
     returned by calls to `getnetgrent' are invalid afterwards.


File: libc.info,  Node: Netgroup Membership,  Prev: Lookup Netgroup,  Up: Netgroup Database

30.16.3 Testing for Netgroup Membership
---------------------------------------

It is often not necessary to scan the whole netgroup since often the
only interesting question is whether a given entry is part of the
selected netgroup.

 -- Function: int innetgr (const char *NETGROUP, const char *HOST,
          const char *USER, const char *DOMAIN)
     Preliminary: | MT-Unsafe race:netgrent locale | AS-Unsafe dlopen
     plugin heap lock | AC-Unsafe corrupt lock fd mem | *Note POSIX
     Safety Concepts::.

     This function tests whether the triple specified by the parameters
     HOST, USER, and DOMAIN is part of the netgroup NETGROUP.  Using
     this function has the advantage that

       1. no other netgroup function can use the global netgroup state
          since internal locking is used and

       2. the function is implemented more efficiently than successive
          calls to the other `set'/`get'/`endnetgrent' functions.

     Any of the pointers HOST, USER, or DOMAIN can be `NULL' which
     means any value is accepted in this position.  This is also true
     for the name `-' which should not match any other string otherwise.

     The return value is `1' if an entry matching the given triple is
     found in the netgroup.  The return value is `0' if the netgroup
     itself is not found, the netgroup does not contain the triple or
     internal errors occurred.

31.1 Host Identification
========================

This section explains how to identify the particular system on which
your program is running.  First, let's review the various ways computer
systems are named, which is a little complicated because of the history
of the development of the Internet.

   Every Unix system (also known as a host) has a host name, whether
it's connected to a network or not.  In its simplest form, as used
before computer networks were an issue, it's just a word like `chicken'.  

   But any system attached to the Internet or any network like it
conforms to a more rigorous naming convention as part of the Domain
Name System (DNS).  In the DNS, every host name is composed of two
parts: 

  1. hostname 

  2. domain name 

   You will note that "hostname" looks a lot like "host name", but is
not the same thing, and that people often incorrectly refer to entire
host names as "domain names."

   In the DNS, the full host name is properly called the FQDN (Fully
Qualified Domain Name) and consists of the hostname, then a period,
then the domain name.  The domain name itself usually has multiple
components separated by periods.  So for example, a system's hostname
may be `chicken' and its domain name might be `ai.mit.edu', so its FQDN
(which is its host name) is `chicken.ai.mit.edu'.  

   Adding to the confusion, though, is that the DNS is not the only
name space in which a computer needs to be known.  Another name space
is the NIS (aka YP) name space.  For NIS purposes, there is another
domain name, which is called the NIS domain name or the YP domain name.
It need not have anything to do with the DNS domain name.  

   Confusing things even more is the fact that in the DNS, it is
possible for multiple FQDNs to refer to the same system.  However,
there is always exactly one of them that is the true host name, and it
is called the canonical FQDN.

   In some contexts, the host name is called a "node name."

   For more information on DNS host naming, see *Note Host Names::.

   Prototypes for these functions appear in `unistd.h'.

   The programs `hostname', `hostid', and `domainname' work by calling
these functions.

 -- Function: int gethostname (char *NAME, size_t SIZE)
     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Safe | AC-Safe | *Note POSIX Safety
     Concepts::.

     This function returns the host name of the system on which it is
     called, in the array NAME.  The SIZE argument specifies the size of
     this array, in bytes.  Note that this is _not_ the DNS hostname.
     If the system participates in the DNS, this is the FQDN (see
     above).

     The return value is `0' on success and `-1' on failure.  In the
     GNU C Library, `gethostname' fails if SIZE is not large enough;
     then you can try again with a larger array.  The following `errno'
     error condition is defined for this function:

    `ENAMETOOLONG'
          The SIZE argument is less than the size of the host name plus
          one.

     On some systems, there is a symbol for the maximum possible host
     name length: `MAXHOSTNAMELEN'.  It is defined in `sys/param.h'.
     But you can't count on this to exist, so it is cleaner to handle
     failure and try again.

     `gethostname' stores the beginning of the host name in NAME even
     if the host name won't entirely fit.  For some purposes, a
     truncated host name is good enough.  If it is, you can ignore the
     error code.

 -- Function: int sethostname (const char *NAME, size_t LENGTH)
     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Safe | AC-Safe | *Note POSIX Safety
     Concepts::.

     The `sethostname' function sets the host name of the system that
     calls it to NAME, a string with length LENGTH.  Only privileged
     processes are permitted to do this.

     Usually `sethostname' gets called just once, at system boot time.
     Often, the program that calls it sets it to the value it finds in
     the file `/etc/hostname'.  

     Be sure to set the host name to the full host name, not just the
     DNS hostname (see above).

     The return value is `0' on success and `-1' on failure.  The
     following `errno' error condition is defined for this function:

    `EPERM'
          This process cannot set the host name because it is not
          privileged.

 -- Function: int getdomainnname (char *NAME, size_t LENGTH)
     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Safe | AC-Safe | *Note POSIX Safety
     Concepts::.

     `getdomainname' returns the NIS (aka YP) domain name of the system
     on which it is called.  Note that this is not the more popular DNS
     domain name.  Get that with `gethostname'.

     The specifics of this function are analogous to `gethostname',
     above.


 -- Function: int setdomainname (const char *NAME, size_t LENGTH)
     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Safe | AC-Safe | *Note POSIX Safety
     Concepts::.

     `setdomainname' sets the NIS (aka YP) domain name of the system on
     which it is called.  Note that this is not the more popular DNS
     domain name.  Set that with `sethostname'.

     The specifics of this function are analogous to `sethostname',
     above.


 -- Function: long int gethostid (void)
     Preliminary: | MT-Safe hostid env locale | AS-Unsafe dlopen plugin
     corrupt heap lock | AC-Unsafe lock corrupt mem fd | *Note POSIX
     Safety Concepts::.

     This function returns the "host ID" of the machine the program is
     running on.  By convention, this is usually the primary Internet
     IP address of that machine, converted to a `long int'.  However,
     on some systems it is a meaningless but unique number which is
     hard-coded for each machine.

     This is not widely used.  It arose in BSD 4.2, but was dropped in
     BSD 4.4.  It is not required by POSIX.

     The proper way to query the IP address is to use `gethostbyname'
     on the results of `gethostname'.  For more information on IP
     addresses, *Note Host Addresses::.

 -- Function: int sethostid (long int ID)
     Preliminary: | MT-Unsafe const:hostid | AS-Unsafe | AC-Unsafe
     corrupt fd | *Note POSIX Safety Concepts::.

     The `sethostid' function sets the "host ID" of the host machine to
     ID.  Only privileged processes are permitted to do this.  Usually
     it happens just once, at system boot time.

     The proper way to establish the primary IP address of a system is
     to configure the IP address resolver to associate that IP address
     with the system's host name as returned by `gethostname'.  For
     example, put a record for the system in `/etc/hosts'.

     See `gethostid' above for more information on host ids.

     The return value is `0' on success and `-1' on failure.  The
     following `errno' error conditions are defined for this function:

    `EPERM'
          This process cannot set the host name because it is not
          privileged.

    `ENOSYS'
          The operating system does not support setting the host ID.
          On some systems, the host ID is a meaningless but unique
          number hard-coded for each machine.

31.2 Platform Type Identification
=================================

You can use the `uname' function to find out some information about the
type of computer your program is running on.  This function and the
associated data type are declared in the header file `sys/utsname.h'.  

   As a bonus, `uname' also gives some information identifying the
particular system your program is running on.  This is the same
information which you can get with functions targeted to this purpose
described in *Note Host Identification::.

 -- Data Type: struct utsname
     The `utsname' structure is used to hold information returned by
     the `uname' function.  It has the following members:

    `char sysname[]'
          This is the name of the operating system in use.

    `char release[]'
          This is the current release level of the operating system
          implementation.

    `char version[]'
          This is the current version level within the release of the
          operating system.

    `char machine[]'
          This is a description of the type of hardware that is in use.

          Some systems provide a mechanism to interrogate the kernel
          directly for this information.  On systems without such a
          mechanism, the GNU C Library fills in this field based on the
          configuration name that was specified when building and
          installing the library.

          GNU uses a three-part name to describe a system
          configuration; the three parts are CPU, MANUFACTURER and
          SYSTEM-TYPE, and they are separated with dashes.  Any
          possible combination of three names is potentially
          meaningful, but most such combinations are meaningless in
          practice and even the meaningful ones are not necessarily
          supported by any particular GNU program.

          Since the value in `machine' is supposed to describe just the
          hardware, it consists of the first two parts of the
          configuration name: `CPU-MANUFACTURER'.  For example, it
          might be one of these:

               `"sparc-sun"', `"i386-ANYTHING"', `"m68k-hp"',
               `"m68k-sony"', `"m68k-sun"', `"mips-dec"'

    `char nodename[]'
          This is the host name of this particular computer.  In the
          GNU C Library, the value is the same as that returned by
          `gethostname'; see *Note Host Identification::.

          `gethostname' is implemented with a call to `uname'.

    `char domainname[]'
          This is the NIS or YP domain name.  It is the same value
          returned by `getdomainname'; see *Note Host Identification::.
          This element is a relatively recent invention and use of it
          is not as portable as use of the rest of the structure.


 -- Function: int uname (struct utsname *INFO)
     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Safe | AC-Safe | *Note POSIX Safety
     Concepts::.

     The `uname' function fills in the structure pointed to by INFO
     with information about the operating system and host machine.  A
     non-negative return value indicates that the data was successfully
     stored.

     `-1' as the return value indicates an error.  The only error
     possible is `EFAULT', which we normally don't mention as it is
     always a possibility.

31.3 Controlling and Querying Mounts
====================================

All files are in filesystems, and before you can access any file, its
filesystem must be mounted.  Because of Unix's concept of _Everything
is a file_, mounting of filesystems is central to doing almost
anything.  This section explains how to find out what filesystems are
currently mounted and what filesystems are available for mounting, and
how to change what is mounted.

   The classic filesystem is the contents of a disk drive.  The concept
is considerably more abstract, though, and lots of things other than
disk drives can be mounted.

   Some block devices don't correspond to traditional devices like disk
drives.  For example, a loop device is a block device whose driver uses
a regular file in another filesystem as its medium.  So if that regular
file contains appropriate data for a filesystem, you can by mounting the
loop device essentially mount a regular file.

   Some filesystems aren't based on a device of any kind.  The "proc"
filesystem, for example, contains files whose data is made up by the
filesystem driver on the fly whenever you ask for it.  And when you
write to it, the data you write causes changes in the system.  No data
gets stored.

31.3.1 Mount Information
------------------------

For some programs it is desirable and necessary to access information
about whether a certain filesystem is mounted and, if it is, where, or
simply to get lists of all the available filesystems.  The GNU C Library
provides some functions to retrieve this information portably.

   Traditionally Unix systems have a file named `/etc/fstab' which
describes all possibly mounted filesystems.  The `mount' program uses
this file to mount at startup time of the system all the necessary
filesystems.  The information about all the filesystems actually
mounted is normally kept in a file named either `/var/run/mtab' or
`/etc/mtab'.  Both files share the same syntax and it is crucial that
this syntax is followed all the time.  Therefore it is best to never
directly write to the files.  The functions described in this section
can do this and they also provide the functionality to convert the
external textual representation to the internal representation.

   Note that the `fstab' and `mtab' files are maintained on a system by
_convention_.  It is possible for the files not to exist or not to be
consistent with what is really mounted or available to mount, if the
system's administration policy allows it.  But programs that mount and
unmount filesystems typically maintain and use these files as described
herein.

   The filenames given above should never be used directly.  The
portable way to handle these files is to use the macros `_PATH_FSTAB',
defined in `fstab.h', or `_PATH_MNTTAB', defined in `mntent.h' and
`paths.h', for `fstab'; and the macro `_PATH_MOUNTED', also defined in
`mntent.h' and `paths.h', for `mtab'.  There are also two alternate
macro names `FSTAB', `MNTTAB', and `MOUNTED' defined but these names
are deprecated and kept only for backward compatibility.  The names
`_PATH_MNTTAB' and `_PATH_MOUNTED' should always be used.

* Menu:

* fstab::                       The `fstab' file

31.3.1.1 The `fstab' file
.........................

The internal representation for entries of the file is `struct fstab',
defined in `fstab.h'.

 -- Data Type: struct fstab
     This structure is used with the `getfsent', `getfsspec', and
     `getfsfile' functions.

    `char *fs_spec'
          This element describes the device from which the filesystem
          is mounted.  Normally this is the name of a special device,
          such as a hard disk partition, but it could also be a more or
          less generic string.  For "NFS" it would be a hostname and
          directory name combination.

          Even though the element is not declared `const' it shouldn't
          be modified.  The missing `const' has historic reasons, since
          this function predates ISO C.  The same is true for the other
          string elements of this structure.

    `char *fs_file'
          This describes the mount point on the local system.  I.e.,
          accessing any file in this filesystem has implicitly or
          explicitly this string as a prefix.

    `char *fs_vfstype'
          This is the type of the filesystem.  Depending on what the
          underlying kernel understands it can be any string.

    `char *fs_mntops'
          This is a string containing options passed to the kernel with
          the `mount' call.  Again, this can be almost anything.  There
          can be more than one option, separated from the others by a
          comma.  Each option consists of a name and an optional value
          part, introduced by an `=' character.

          If the value of this element must be processed it should
          ideally be done using the `getsubopt' function; see *Note
          Suboptions::.

    `const char *fs_type'
          This name is poorly chosen.  This element points to a string
          (possibly in the `fs_mntops' string) which describes the
          modes with which the filesystem is mounted.  `fstab' defines
          five macros to describe the possible values:

         `FSTAB_RW'
               The filesystem gets mounted with read and write enabled.

         `FSTAB_RQ'
               The filesystem gets mounted with read and write enabled.
               Write access is restricted by quotas.

         `FSTAB_RO'
               The filesystem gets mounted read-only.

         `FSTAB_SW'
               This is not a real filesystem, it is a swap device.

         `FSTAB_XX'
               This entry from the `fstab' file is totally ignored.

          Testing for equality with these values must happen using
          `strcmp' since these are all strings.  Comparing the pointer
          will probably always fail.

    `int fs_freq'
          This element describes the dump frequency in days.

    `int fs_passno'
          This element describes the pass number on parallel dumps.  It
          is closely related to the `dump' utility used on Unix systems.

   To read the entire content of the of the `fstab' file the GNU C
Library contains a set of three functions which are designed in the
usual way.

 -- Function: int setfsent (void)
     Preliminary: | MT-Unsafe race:fsent | AS-Unsafe heap corrupt lock
     | AC-Unsafe corrupt lock mem fd | *Note POSIX Safety Concepts::.

     This function makes sure that the internal read pointer for the
     `fstab' file is at the beginning of the file.  This is done by
     either opening the file or resetting the read pointer.

     Since the file handle is internal to the libc this function is not
     thread-safe.

     This function returns a non-zero value if the operation was
     successful and the `getfs*' functions can be used to read the
     entries of the file.

 -- Function: void endfsent (void)
     Preliminary: | MT-Unsafe race:fsent | AS-Unsafe heap corrupt lock
     | AC-Unsafe corrupt lock mem fd | *Note POSIX Safety Concepts::.

     This function makes sure that all resources acquired by a prior
     call to `setfsent' (explicitly or implicitly by calling
     `getfsent') are freed.

 -- Function: struct fstab * getfsent (void)
     Preliminary: | MT-Unsafe race:fsent locale | AS-Unsafe corrupt
     heap lock | AC-Unsafe corrupt lock mem | *Note POSIX Safety
     Concepts::.

     This function returns the next entry of the `fstab' file.  If this
     is the first call to any of the functions handling `fstab' since
     program start or the last call of `endfsent', the file will be
     opened.

     The function returns a pointer to a variable of type `struct
     fstab'.  This variable is shared by all threads and therefore this
     function is not thread-safe.  If an error occurred `getfsent'
     returns a `NULL' pointer.

 -- Function: struct fstab * getfsspec (const char *NAME)
     Preliminary: | MT-Unsafe race:fsent locale | AS-Unsafe corrupt
     heap lock | AC-Unsafe corrupt lock mem | *Note POSIX Safety
     Concepts::.

     This function returns the next entry of the `fstab' file which has
     a string equal to NAME pointed to by the `fs_spec' element.  Since
     there is normally exactly one entry for each special device it
     makes no sense to call this function more than once for the same
     argument.  If this is the first call to any of the functions
     handling `fstab' since program start or the last call of
     `endfsent', the file will be opened.

     The function returns a pointer to a variable of type `struct
     fstab'.  This variable is shared by all threads and therefore this
     function is not thread-safe.  If an error occurred `getfsent'
     returns a `NULL' pointer.

 -- Function: struct fstab * getfsfile (const char *NAME)
     Preliminary: | MT-Unsafe race:fsent locale | AS-Unsafe corrupt
     heap lock | AC-Unsafe corrupt lock mem | *Note POSIX Safety
     Concepts::.

     This function returns the next entry of the `fstab' file which has
     a string equal to NAME pointed to by the `fs_file' element.  Since
     there is normally exactly one entry for each mount point it makes
     no sense to call this function more than once for the same
     argument.  If this is the first call to any of the functions
     handling `fstab' since program start or the last call of
     `endfsent', the file will be opened.

     The function returns a pointer to a variable of type `struct
     fstab'.  This variable is shared by all threads and therefore this
     function is not thread-safe.  If an error occurred `getfsent'
     returns a `NULL' pointer.

31.3.1.2 The `mtab' file
........................

The following functions and data structure access the `mtab' file.

 -- Data Type: struct mntent
     This structure is used with the `getmntent', `getmntent_r',
     `addmntent', and `hasmntopt' functions.

    `char *mnt_fsname'
          This element contains a pointer to a string describing the
          name of the special device from which the filesystem is
          mounted.  It corresponds to the `fs_spec' element in `struct
          fstab'.

    `char *mnt_dir'
          This element points to a string describing the mount point of
          the filesystem.  It corresponds to the `fs_file' element in
          `struct fstab'.

    `char *mnt_type'
          `mnt_type' describes the filesystem type and is therefore
          equivalent to `fs_vfstype' in `struct fstab'.  `mntent.h'
          defines a few symbolic names for some of the values this
          string can have.  But since the kernel can support arbitrary
          filesystems it does not make much sense to give them symbolic
          names.  If one knows the symbol name one also knows the
          filesystem name.  Nevertheless here follows the list of the
          symbols provided in `mntent.h'.

         `MNTTYPE_IGNORE'
               This symbol expands to `"ignore"'.  The value is
               sometimes used in `fstab' files to make sure entries are
               not used without removing them.

         `MNTTYPE_NFS'
               Expands to `"nfs"'.  Using this macro sometimes could
               make sense since it names the default NFS
               implementation, in case both version 2 and 3 are
               supported.

         `MNTTYPE_SWAP'
               This symbol expands to `"swap"'.  It names the special
               `fstab' entry which names one of the possibly multiple
               swap partitions.

    `char *mnt_opts'
          The element contains a string describing the options used
          while mounting the filesystem.  As for the equivalent element
          `fs_mntops' of `struct fstab' it is best to use the function
          `getsubopt' (*note Suboptions::) to access the parts of this
          string.

          The `mntent.h' file defines a number of macros with string
          values which correspond to some of the options understood by
          the kernel.  There might be many more options which are
          possible so it doesn't make much sense to rely on these
          macros but to be consistent here is the list:

         `MNTOPT_DEFAULTS'
               Expands to `"defaults"'.  This option should be used
               alone since it indicates all values for the customizable
               values are chosen to be the default.

         `MNTOPT_RO'
               Expands to `"ro"'.  See the `FSTAB_RO' value, it means
               the filesystem is mounted read-only.

         `MNTOPT_RW'
               Expands to `"rw"'.  See the `FSTAB_RW' value, it means
               the filesystem is mounted with read and write
               permissions.

         `MNTOPT_SUID'
               Expands to `"suid"'.  This means that the SUID bit
               (*note How Change Persona::) is respected when a program
               from the filesystem is started.

         `MNTOPT_NOSUID'
               Expands to `"nosuid"'.  This is the opposite of
               `MNTOPT_SUID', the SUID bit for all files from the
               filesystem is ignored.

         `MNTOPT_NOAUTO'
               Expands to `"noauto"'.  At startup time the `mount'
               program will ignore this entry if it is started with the
               `-a' option to mount all filesystems mentioned in the
               `fstab' file.

          As for the `FSTAB_*' entries introduced above it is important
          to use `strcmp' to check for equality.

    `mnt_freq'
          This elements corresponds to `fs_freq' and also specifies the
          frequency in days in which dumps are made.

    `mnt_passno'
          This element is equivalent to `fs_passno' with the same
          meaning which is uninteresting for all programs beside `dump'.

   For accessing the `mtab' file there is again a set of three
functions to access all entries in a row.  Unlike the functions to
handle `fstab' these functions do not access a fixed file and there is
even a thread safe variant of the get function.  Besides this the GNU C
Library contains functions to alter the file and test for specific
options.

 -- Function: FILE * setmntent (const char *FILE, const char *MODE)
     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Unsafe heap lock | AC-Unsafe mem fd
     lock | *Note POSIX Safety Concepts::.

     The `setmntent' function prepares the file named FILE which must
     be in the format of a `fstab' and `mtab' file for the upcoming
     processing through the other functions of the family.  The MODE
     parameter can be chosen in the way the OPENTYPE parameter for
     `fopen' (*note Opening Streams::) can be chosen.  If the file is
     opened for writing the file is also allowed to be empty.

     If the file was successfully opened `setmntent' returns a file
     handle for future use.  Otherwise the return value is `NULL' and
     `errno' is set accordingly.

 -- Function: int endmntent (FILE *STREAM)
     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Unsafe heap lock | AC-Unsafe lock mem
     fd | *Note POSIX Safety Concepts::.

     This function takes for the STREAM parameter a file handle which
     previously was returned from the `setmntent' call.  `endmntent'
     closes the stream and frees all resources.

     The return value is 1 unless an error occurred in which case it is
     0.

 -- Function: struct mntent * getmntent (FILE *STREAM)
     Preliminary: | MT-Unsafe race:mntentbuf locale | AS-Unsafe corrupt
     heap init | AC-Unsafe init corrupt lock mem | *Note POSIX Safety
     Concepts::.

     The `getmntent' function takes as the parameter a file handle
     previously returned by a successful call to `setmntent'.  It
     returns a pointer to a static variable of type `struct mntent'
     which is filled with the information from the next entry from the
     file currently read.

     The file format used prescribes the use of spaces or tab
     characters to separate the fields.  This makes it harder to use
     names containing one of these characters (e.g., mount points using
     spaces).  Therefore these characters are encoded in the files and
     the `getmntent' function takes care of the decoding while reading
     the entries back in.  `'\040'' is used to encode a space
     character, `'\011'' to encode a tab character, `'\012'' to encode
     a newline character, and `'\\'' to encode a backslash.

     If there was an error or the end of the file is reached the return
     value is `NULL'.

     This function is not thread-safe since all calls to this function
     return a pointer to the same static variable.  `getmntent_r'
     should be used in situations where multiple threads access the
     file.

 -- Function: struct mntent * getmntent_r (FILE *STREAM, struct mntent
          *RESULT, char *BUFFER, int BUFSIZE)
     Preliminary: | MT-Safe locale | AS-Unsafe corrupt heap | AC-Unsafe
     corrupt lock mem | *Note POSIX Safety Concepts::.

     The `getmntent_r' function is the reentrant variant of
     `getmntent'.  It also returns the next entry from the file and
     returns a pointer.  The actual variable the values are stored in
     is not static, though.  Instead the function stores the values in
     the variable pointed to by the RESULT parameter.  Additional
     information (e.g., the strings pointed to by the elements of the
     result) are kept in the buffer of size BUFSIZE pointed to by
     BUFFER.

     Escaped characters (space, tab, backslash) are converted back in
     the same way as it happens for `getmentent'.

     The function returns a `NULL' pointer in error cases.  Errors
     could be:
        * error while reading the file,

        * end of file reached,

        * BUFSIZE is too small for reading a complete new entry.

 -- Function: int addmntent (FILE *STREAM, const struct mntent *MNT)
     Preliminary: | MT-Safe race:stream locale | AS-Unsafe corrupt |
     AC-Unsafe corrupt | *Note POSIX Safety Concepts::.

     The `addmntent' function allows adding a new entry to the file
     previously opened with `setmntent'.  The new entries are always
     appended.  I.e., even if the position of the file descriptor is
     not at the end of the file this function does not overwrite an
     existing entry following the current position.

     The implication of this is that to remove an entry from a file one
     has to create a new file while leaving out the entry to be removed
     and after closing the file remove the old one and rename the new
     file to the chosen name.

     This function takes care of spaces and tab characters in the names
     to be written to the file.  It converts them and the backslash
     character into the format described in the `getmntent' description
     above.

     This function returns 0 in case the operation was successful.
     Otherwise the return value is 1 and `errno' is set appropriately.

 -- Function: char * hasmntopt (const struct mntent *MNT, const char
          *OPT)
     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Safe | AC-Safe | *Note POSIX Safety
     Concepts::.

     This function can be used to check whether the string pointed to
     by the `mnt_opts' element of the variable pointed to by MNT
     contains the option OPT.  If this is true a pointer to the
     beginning of the option in the `mnt_opts' element is returned.  If
     no such option exists the function returns `NULL'.

     This function is useful to test whether a specific option is
     present but when all options have to be processed one is better
     off with using the `getsubopt' function to iterate over all
     options in the string.

31.3.1.3 Other (Non-libc) Sources of Mount Information
......................................................

On a system with a Linux kernel and the `proc' filesystem, you can get
information on currently mounted filesystems from the file `mounts' in
the `proc' filesystem.  Its format is similar to that of the `mtab'
file, but represents what is truly mounted without relying on
facilities outside the kernel to keep `mtab' up to date.


File: libc.info,  Node: Mount-Unmount-Remount,  Prev: Mount Information,  Up: Filesystem Handling

31.3.2 Mount, Unmount, Remount
------------------------------

This section describes the functions for mounting, unmounting, and
remounting filesystems.

   Only the superuser can mount, unmount, or remount a filesystem.

   These functions do not access the `fstab' and `mtab' files.  You
should maintain and use these separately.  *Note Mount Information::.

   The symbols in this section are declared in `sys/mount.h'.

 -- Function: int mount (const char *SPECIAL_FILE, const char *DIR,
          const char *FSTYPE, unsigned long int OPTIONS, const void
          *DATA)
     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Safe | AC-Safe | *Note POSIX Safety
     Concepts::.

     `mount' mounts or remounts a filesystem.  The two operations are
     quite different and are merged rather unnaturally into this one
     function.  The `MS_REMOUNT' option, explained below, determines
     whether `mount' mounts or remounts.

     For a mount, the filesystem on the block device represented by the
     device special file named SPECIAL_FILE gets mounted over the mount
     point DIR.  This means that the directory DIR (along with any
     files in it) is no longer visible; in its place (and still with
     the name DIR) is the root directory of the filesystem on the
     device.

     As an exception, if the filesystem type (see below) is one which
     is not based on a device (e.g. "proc"), `mount' instantiates a
     filesystem and mounts it over DIR and ignores SPECIAL_FILE.

     For a remount, DIR specifies the mount point where the filesystem
     to be remounted is (and remains) mounted and SPECIAL_FILE is
     ignored.  Remounting a filesystem means changing the options that
     control operations on the filesystem while it is mounted.  It does
     not mean unmounting and mounting again.

     For a mount, you must identify the type of the filesystem with
     FSTYPE.  This type tells the kernel how to access the filesystem
     and can be thought of as the name of a filesystem driver.  The
     acceptable values are system dependent.  On a system with a Linux
     kernel and the `proc' filesystem, the list of possible values is
     in the file `filesystems' in the `proc' filesystem (e.g. type `cat
     /proc/filesystems' to see the list).  With a Linux kernel, the
     types of filesystems that `mount' can mount, and their type names,
     depends on what filesystem drivers are configured into the kernel
     or loaded as loadable kernel modules.  An example of a common
     value for FSTYPE is `ext2'.

     For a remount, `mount' ignores FSTYPE.

     OPTIONS specifies a variety of options that apply until the
     filesystem is unmounted or remounted.  The precise meaning of an
     option depends on the filesystem and with some filesystems, an
     option may have no effect at all.  Furthermore, for some
     filesystems, some of these options (but never `MS_RDONLY') can be
     overridden for individual file accesses via `ioctl'.

     OPTIONS is a bit string with bit fields defined using the
     following mask and masked value macros:

    `MS_MGC_MASK'
          This multibit field contains a magic number.  If it does not
          have the value `MS_MGC_VAL', `mount' assumes all the
          following bits are zero and the DATA argument is a null
          string, regardless of their actual values.

    `MS_REMOUNT'
          This bit on means to remount the filesystem.  Off means to
          mount it.

    `MS_RDONLY'
          This bit on specifies that no writing to the filesystem shall
          be allowed while it is mounted.  This cannot be overridden by
          `ioctl'.  This option is available on nearly all filesystems.

    `MS_NOSUID'
          This bit on specifies that Setuid and Setgid permissions on
          files in the filesystem shall be ignored while it is mounted.

    `MS_NOEXEC'
          This bit on specifies that no files in the filesystem shall
          be executed while the filesystem is mounted.

    `MS_NODEV'
          This bit on specifies that no device special files in the
          filesystem shall be accessible while the filesystem is
          mounted.

    `MS_SYNCHRONOUS'
          This bit on specifies that all writes to the filesystem while
          it is mounted shall be synchronous; i.e., data shall be
          synced before each write completes rather than held in the
          buffer cache.

    `MS_MANDLOCK'
          This bit on specifies that mandatory locks on files shall be
          permitted while the filesystem is mounted.

    `MS_NOATIME'
          This bit on specifies that access times of files shall not be
          updated when the files are accessed while the filesystem is
          mounted.

    `MS_NODIRATIME'
          This bit on specifies that access times of directories shall
          not be updated when the directories are accessed while the
          filesystem in mounted.


     Any bits not covered by the above masks should be set off;
     otherwise, results are undefined.

     The meaning of DATA depends on the filesystem type and is
     controlled entirely by the filesystem driver in the kernel.

     Example:

          #include <sys/mount.h>

          mount("/dev/hdb", "/cdrom", MS_MGC_VAL | MS_RDONLY | MS_NOSUID, "");

          mount("/dev/hda2", "/mnt", MS_MGC_VAL | MS_REMOUNT, "");

     Appropriate arguments for `mount' are conventionally recorded in
     the `fstab' table.  *Note Mount Information::.

     The return value is zero if the mount or remount is successful.
     Otherwise, it is `-1' and `errno' is set appropriately.  The
     values of `errno' are filesystem dependent, but here is a general
     list:

    `EPERM'
          The process is not superuser.

    `ENODEV'
          The file system type FSTYPE is not known to the kernel.

    `ENOTBLK'
          The file DEV is not a block device special file.

    `EBUSY'
             * The device is already mounted.

             * The mount point is busy.  (E.g. it is some process'
               working directory or has a filesystem mounted on it
               already).

             * The request is to remount read-only, but there are files
               open for writing.

    `EINVAL'
             * A remount was attempted, but there is no filesystem
               mounted over the specified mount point.

             * The supposed filesystem has an invalid superblock.


    `EACCES'
             * The filesystem is inherently read-only (possibly due to
               a switch on the device) and the process attempted to
               mount it read/write (by setting the `MS_RDONLY' bit off).

             * SPECIAL_FILE or DIR is not accessible due to file
               permissions.

             * SPECIAL_FILE is not accessible because it is in a
               filesystem that is mounted with the `MS_NODEV' option.


    `EM_FILE'
          The table of dummy devices is full.  `mount' needs to create a
          dummy device (aka "unnamed" device) if the filesystem being
          mounted is not one that uses a device.



 -- Function: int umount2 (const char *FILE, int FLAGS)
     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Safe | AC-Safe | *Note POSIX Safety
     Concepts::.

     `umount2' unmounts a filesystem.

     You can identify the filesystem to unmount either by the device
     special file that contains the filesystem or by the mount point.
     The effect is the same.  Specify either as the string FILE.

     FLAGS contains the one-bit field identified by the following mask
     macro:

    `MNT_FORCE'
          This bit on means to force the unmounting even if the
          filesystem is busy, by making it unbusy first.  If the bit is
          off and the filesystem is busy, `umount2' fails with `errno'
          = `EBUSY'.  Depending on the filesystem, this may override
          all, some, or no busy conditions.


     All other bits in FLAGS should be set to zero; otherwise, the
     result is undefined.

     Example:

          #include <sys/mount.h>

          umount2("/mnt", MNT_FORCE);

          umount2("/dev/hdd1", 0);

     After the filesystem is unmounted, the directory that was the
     mount point is visible, as are any files in it.

     As part of unmounting, `umount2' syncs the filesystem.

     If the unmounting is successful, the return value is zero.
     Otherwise, it is `-1' and `errno' is set accordingly:

    `EPERM'
          The process is not superuser.

    `EBUSY'
          The filesystem cannot be unmounted because it is busy.  E.g.
          it contains a directory that is some process's working
          directory or a file that some process has open.  With some
          filesystems in some cases, you can avoid this failure with
          the `MNT_FORCE' option.

    `EINVAL'
          FILE validly refers to a file, but that file is neither a
          mount point nor a device special file of a currently mounted
          filesystem.


     This function is not available on all systems.

 -- Function: int umount (const char *FILE)
     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Safe | AC-Safe | *Note POSIX Safety
     Concepts::.

     `umount' does the same thing as `umount2' with FLAGS set to
     zeroes.  It is more widely available than `umount2' but since it
     lacks the possibility to forcefully unmount a filesystem is
     deprecated when `umount2' is also available.

31.4 System Parameters
======================

This section describes the `sysctl' function, which gets and sets a
variety of system parameters.

   The symbols used in this section are declared in the file
`sys/sysctl.h'.

 -- Function: int sysctl (int *NAMES, int NLEN, void *OLDVAL, size_t
          *OLDLENP, void *NEWVAL, size_t NEWLEN)
     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Safe | AC-Safe | *Note POSIX Safety
     Concepts::.

     `sysctl' gets or sets a specified system parameter.  There are so
     many of these parameters that it is not practical to list them all
     here, but here are some examples:

        * network domain name

        * paging parameters

        * network Address Resolution Protocol timeout time

        * maximum number of files that may be open

        * root filesystem device

        * when kernel was built

     The set of available parameters depends on the kernel
     configuration and can change while the system is running,
     particularly when you load and unload loadable kernel modules.

     The system parameters with which `sysctl' is concerned are arranged
     in a hierarchical structure like a hierarchical filesystem.  To
     identify a particular parameter, you specify a path through the
     structure in a way analogous to specifying the pathname of a file.
     Each component of the path is specified by an integer and each of
     these integers has a macro defined for it by `sys/sysctl.h'.
     NAMES is the path, in the form of an array of integers.  Each
     component of the path is one element of the array, in order.  NLEN
     is the number of components in the path.

     For example, the first component of the path for all the paging
     parameters is the value `CTL_VM'.  For the free page thresholds,
     the second component of the path is `VM_FREEPG'.  So to get the
     free page threshold values, make NAMES an array containing the two
     elements `CTL_VM' and `VM_FREEPG' and make NLEN = 2.

     The format of the value of a parameter depends on the parameter.
     Sometimes it is an integer; sometimes it is an ASCII string;
     sometimes it is an elaborate structure.  In the case of the free
     page thresholds used in the example above, the parameter value is
     a structure containing several integers.

     In any case, you identify a place to return the parameter's value
     with OLDVAL and specify the amount of storage available at that
     location as *OLDLENP.  *OLDLENP does double duty because it is
     also the output location that contains the actual length of the
     returned value.

     If you don't want the parameter value returned, specify a null
     pointer for OLDVAL.

     To set the parameter, specify the address and length of the new
     value as NEWVAL and NEWLEN.  If you don't want to set the
     parameter, specify a null pointer as NEWVAL.

     If you get and set a parameter in the same `sysctl' call, the value
     returned is the value of the parameter before it was set.

     Each system parameter has a set of permissions similar to the
     permissions for a file (including the permissions on directories
     in its path) that determine whether you may get or set it.  For
     the purposes of these permissions, every parameter is considered
     to be owned by the superuser and Group 0 so processes with that
     effective uid or gid may have more access to system parameters.
     Unlike with files, the superuser does not invariably have full
     permission to all system parameters, because some of them are
     designed not to be changed ever.

     `sysctl' returns a zero return value if it succeeds.  Otherwise, it
     returns `-1' and sets `errno' appropriately.  Besides the failures
     that apply to all system calls, the following are the `errno'
     codes for all possible failures:

    `EPERM'
          The process is not permitted to access one of the components
          of the path of the system parameter or is not permitted to
          access the system parameter itself in the way (read or write)
          that it requested.

    `ENOTDIR'
          There is no system parameter corresponding to NAME.

    `EFAULT'
          OLDVAL is not null, which means the process wanted to read
          the parameter, but *OLDLENP is zero, so there is no place to
          return it.

    `EINVAL'
             * The process attempted to set a system parameter to a
               value that is not valid for that parameter.

             * The space provided for the return of the system
               parameter is not the right size for that parameter.

    `ENOMEM'
          This value may be returned instead of the more correct
          `EINVAL' in some cases where the space provided for the
          return of the system parameter is too small.



   If you have a Linux kernel with the `proc' filesystem, you can get
and set most of the same parameters by reading and writing to files in
the `sys' directory of the `proc' filesystem.  In the `sys' directory,
the directory structure represents the hierarchical structure of the
parameters.  E.g. you can display the free page thresholds with
     cat /proc/sys/vm/freepages

   Some more traditional and more widely available, though less general,
GNU C Library functions for getting and setting some of the same system
parameters are:

   * `getdomainname', `setdomainname'

   * `gethostname', `sethostname' (*Note Host Identification::.)

   * `uname' (*Note Platform Type::.)

32.1 General Capacity Limits
============================

The POSIX.1 and POSIX.2 standards specify a number of parameters that
describe capacity limitations of the system.  These limits can be fixed
constants for a given operating system, or they can vary from machine to
machine.  For example, some limit values may be configurable by the
system administrator, either at run time or by rebuilding the kernel,
and this should not require recompiling application programs.

   Each of the following limit parameters has a macro that is defined in
`limits.h' only if the system has a fixed, uniform limit for the
parameter in question.  If the system allows different file systems or
files to have different limits, then the macro is undefined; use
`sysconf' to find out the limit that applies at a particular time on a
particular machine.  *Note Sysconf::.

   Each of these parameters also has another macro, with a name starting
with `_POSIX', which gives the lowest value that the limit is allowed
to have on _any_ POSIX system.  *Note Minimums::.

 -- Macro: int ARG_MAX
     If defined, the unvarying maximum combined length of the ARGV and
     ENVIRON arguments that can be passed to the `exec' functions.

 -- Macro: int CHILD_MAX
     If defined, the unvarying maximum number of processes that can
     exist with the same real user ID at any one time.  In BSD and GNU,
     this is controlled by the `RLIMIT_NPROC' resource limit; *note
     Limits on Resources::.

 -- Macro: int OPEN_MAX
     If defined, the unvarying maximum number of files that a single
     process can have open simultaneously.  In BSD and GNU, this is
     controlled by the `RLIMIT_NOFILE' resource limit; *note Limits on
     Resources::.

 -- Macro: int STREAM_MAX
     If defined, the unvarying maximum number of streams that a single
     process can have open simultaneously.  *Note Opening Streams::.

 -- Macro: int TZNAME_MAX
     If defined, the unvarying maximum length of a time zone name.
     *Note Time Zone Functions::.

   These limit macros are always defined in `limits.h'.

 -- Macro: int NGROUPS_MAX
     The maximum number of supplementary group IDs that one process can
     have.

     The value of this macro is actually a lower bound for the maximum.
     That is, you can count on being able to have that many
     supplementary group IDs, but a particular machine might let you
     have even more.  You can use `sysconf' to see whether a particular
     machine will let you have more (*note Sysconf::).

 -- Macro: ssize_t SSIZE_MAX
     The largest value that can fit in an object of type `ssize_t'.
     Effectively, this is the limit on the number of bytes that can be
     read or written in a single operation.

     This macro is defined in all POSIX systems because this limit is
     never configurable.

 -- Macro: int RE_DUP_MAX
     The largest number of repetitions you are guaranteed is allowed in
     the construct `\{MIN,MAX\}' in a regular expression.

     The value of this macro is actually a lower bound for the maximum.
     That is, you can count on being able to have that many
     repetitions, but a particular machine might let you have even
     more.  You can use `sysconf' to see whether a particular machine
     will let you have more (*note Sysconf::).  And even the value that
     `sysconf' tells you is just a lower bound--larger values might
     work.

     This macro is defined in all POSIX.2 systems, because POSIX.2 says
     it should always be defined even if there is no specific imposed
     limit.

32.2 Overall System Options
===========================

POSIX defines certain system-specific options that not all POSIX systems
support.  Since these options are provided in the kernel, not in the
library, simply using the GNU C Library does not guarantee any of these
features are supported; it depends on the system you are using.

   You can test for the availability of a given option using the macros
in this section, together with the function `sysconf'.  The macros are
defined only if you include `unistd.h'.

   For the following macros, if the macro is defined in `unistd.h',
then the option is supported.  Otherwise, the option may or may not be
supported; use `sysconf' to find out.  *Note Sysconf::.

 -- Macro: int _POSIX_JOB_CONTROL
     If this symbol is defined, it indicates that the system supports
     job control.  Otherwise, the implementation behaves as if all
     processes within a session belong to a single process group.
     *Note Job Control::.

 -- Macro: int _POSIX_SAVED_IDS
     If this symbol is defined, it indicates that the system remembers
     the effective user and group IDs of a process before it executes an
     executable file with the set-user-ID or set-group-ID bits set, and
     that explicitly changing the effective user or group IDs back to
     these values is permitted.  If this option is not defined, then if
     a nonprivileged process changes its effective user or group ID to
     the real user or group ID of the process, it can't change it back
     again.  *Note Enable/Disable Setuid::.

   For the following macros, if the macro is defined in `unistd.h',
then its value indicates whether the option is supported.  A value of
`-1' means no, and any other value means yes.  If the macro is not
defined, then the option may or may not be supported; use `sysconf' to
find out.  *Note Sysconf::.

 -- Macro: int _POSIX2_C_DEV
     If this symbol is defined, it indicates that the system has the
     POSIX.2 C compiler command, `c89'.  The GNU C Library always
     defines this as `1', on the assumption that you would not have
     installed it if you didn't have a C compiler.

 -- Macro: int _POSIX2_FORT_DEV
     If this symbol is defined, it indicates that the system has the
     POSIX.2 Fortran compiler command, `fort77'.  The GNU C Library
     never defines this, because we don't know what the system has.

 -- Macro: int _POSIX2_FORT_RUN
     If this symbol is defined, it indicates that the system has the
     POSIX.2 `asa' command to interpret Fortran carriage control.  The
     GNU C Library never defines this, because we don't know what the
     system has.

 -- Macro: int _POSIX2_LOCALEDEF
     If this symbol is defined, it indicates that the system has the
     POSIX.2 `localedef' command.  The GNU C Library never defines
     this, because we don't know what the system has.

 -- Macro: int _POSIX2_SW_DEV
     If this symbol is defined, it indicates that the system has the
     POSIX.2 commands `ar', `make', and `strip'.  The GNU C Library
     always defines this as `1', on the assumption that you had to have
     `ar' and `make' to install the library, and it's unlikely that
     `strip' would be absent when those are present.


File: libc.info,  Node: Version Supported,  Next: Sysconf,  Prev: System Options,  Up: System Configuration

32.3 Which Version of POSIX is Supported
========================================

 -- Macro: long int _POSIX_VERSION
     This constant represents the version of the POSIX.1 standard to
     which the implementation conforms.  For an implementation
     conforming to the 1995 POSIX.1 standard, the value is the integer
     `199506L'.

     `_POSIX_VERSION' is always defined (in `unistd.h') in any POSIX
     system.

     *Usage Note:* Don't try to test whether the system supports POSIX
     by including `unistd.h' and then checking whether `_POSIX_VERSION'
     is defined.  On a non-POSIX system, this will probably fail
     because there is no `unistd.h'.  We do not know of _any_ way you
     can reliably test at compilation time whether your target system
     supports POSIX or whether `unistd.h' exists.

 -- Macro: long int _POSIX2_C_VERSION
     This constant represents the version of the POSIX.2 standard which
     the library and system kernel support.  We don't know what value
     this will be for the first version of the POSIX.2 standard,
     because the value is based on the year and month in which the
     standard is officially adopted.

     The value of this symbol says nothing about the utilities
     installed on the system.

     *Usage Note:* You can use this macro to tell whether a POSIX.1
     system library supports POSIX.2 as well.  Any POSIX.1 system
     contains `unistd.h', so include that file and then test `defined
     (_POSIX2_C_VERSION)'.

32.4 Using `sysconf'

`sysconf' function to find out the value that applies to any particular
machine.  The function and the associated PARAMETER constants are

------------------------------

 -- Function: long int sysconf (int PARAMETER)
     Preliminary: | MT-Safe env | AS-Unsafe lock heap | AC-Unsafe lock

     This function is used to inquire about runtime system parameters.
     The PARAMETER argument should be one of the `_SC_' symbols listed
     below.

     The normal return value from `sysconf' is the value you requested.
     A value of `-1' is returned both if the implementation does not
     impose a limit, and in case of an error.

     The following `errno' error conditions are defined for this
     function:

    `EINVAL'

32.4.3 Examples of `sysconf'
----------------------------

We recommend that you first test for a macro definition for the
parameter you are interested in, and call `sysconf' only if the macro
is not defined.  For example, here is how to test whether job control
is supported:

     int
     have_job_control (void)
     {
     #ifdef _POSIX_JOB_CONTROL
       return 1;
     #else
       int value = sysconf (_SC_JOB_CONTROL);
       if (value < 0)
         /* If the system is that badly wedged,
            there's no use trying to go on.  */
         fatal (strerror (errno));
       return value;
     #endif
     }

   Here is how to get the value of a numeric limit:

     int
     get_child_max ()
     {
     #ifdef CHILD_MAX
       return CHILD_MAX;
     #else
       int value = sysconf (_SC_CHILD_MAX);
       if (value < 0)
         fatal (strerror (errno));
       return value;
     #endif
     }

32.5 Minimum Values for General Capacity Limits
===============================================

Here are the names for the POSIX minimum upper bounds for the system
limit parameters.  The significance of these values is that you can
safely push to these limits without checking whether the particular
system you are using can go that far.

`_POSIX_AIO_LISTIO_MAX'
     The most restrictive limit permitted by POSIX for the maximum
     number of I/O operations that can be specified in a list I/O call.
     The value of this constant is `2'; thus you can add up to two new
     entries of the list of outstanding operations.

`_POSIX_AIO_MAX'
     The most restrictive limit permitted by POSIX for the maximum
     number of outstanding asynchronous I/O operations.  The value of
     this constant is `1'.  So you cannot expect that you can issue
     more than one operation and immediately continue with the normal
     work, receiving the notifications asynchronously.

`_POSIX_ARG_MAX'
     The value of this macro is the most restrictive limit permitted by
     POSIX for the maximum combined length of the ARGV and ENVIRON
     arguments that can be passed to the `exec' functions.  Its value
     is `4096'.

`_POSIX_CHILD_MAX'
     The value of this macro is the most restrictive limit permitted by
     POSIX for the maximum number of simultaneous processes per real
     user ID.  Its value is `6'.

`_POSIX_NGROUPS_MAX'
     The value of this macro is the most restrictive limit permitted by
     POSIX for the maximum number of supplementary group IDs per
     process.  Its value is `0'.

`_POSIX_OPEN_MAX'
     The value of this macro is the most restrictive limit permitted by
     POSIX for the maximum number of files that a single process can
     have open simultaneously.  Its value is `16'.

`_POSIX_SSIZE_MAX'
     The value of this macro is the most restrictive limit permitted by
     POSIX for the maximum value that can be stored in an object of type
     `ssize_t'.  Its value is `32767'.

`_POSIX_STREAM_MAX'
     The value of this macro is the most restrictive limit permitted by
     POSIX for the maximum number of streams that a single process can
     have open simultaneously.  Its value is `8'.

`_POSIX_TZNAME_MAX'
     The value of this macro is the most restrictive limit permitted by
     POSIX for the maximum length of a time zone name.  Its value is
     `3'.

`_POSIX2_RE_DUP_MAX'
     The value of this macro is the most restrictive limit permitted by
     POSIX for the numbers used in the `\{MIN,MAX\}' construct in a
     regular expression.  Its value is `255'.

32.6 Limits on File System Capacity
===================================

The POSIX.1 standard specifies a number of parameters that describe the
limitations of the file system.  It's possible for the system to have a
fixed, uniform limit for a parameter, but this isn't the usual case.  On
most systems, it's possible for different file systems (and, for some
parameters, even different files) to have different maximum limits.  For
example, this is very likely if you use NFS to mount some of the file
systems from other machines.

   Each of the following macros is defined in `limits.h' only if the
system has a fixed, uniform limit for the parameter in question.  If the
system allows different file systems or files to have different limits,
then the macro is undefined; use `pathconf' or `fpathconf' to find out
the limit that applies to a particular file.  *Note Pathconf::.

   Each parameter also has another macro, with a name starting with
`_POSIX', which gives the lowest value that the limit is allowed to
have on _any_ POSIX system.  *Note File Minimums::.

 -- Macro: int LINK_MAX
     The uniform system limit (if any) for the number of names for a
     given file.  *Note Hard Links::.

 -- Macro: int MAX_CANON
     The uniform system limit (if any) for the amount of text in a line
     of input when input editing is enabled.  *Note Canonical or Not::.

 -- Macro: int MAX_INPUT
     The uniform system limit (if any) for the total number of
     characters typed ahead as input.  *Note I/O Queues::.

 -- Macro: int NAME_MAX
     The uniform system limit (if any) for the length of a file name
     component, not including the terminating null character.

     *Portability Note:* On some systems, the GNU C Library defines
     `NAME_MAX', but does not actually enforce this limit.

 -- Macro: int PATH_MAX
     The uniform system limit (if any) for the length of an entire file
     name (that is, the argument given to system calls such as `open'),
     including the terminating null character.

     *Portability Note:* The GNU C Library does not enforce this limit
     even if `PATH_MAX' is defined.

 -- Macro: int PIPE_BUF
     The uniform system limit (if any) for the number of bytes that can
     be written atomically to a pipe.  If multiple processes are
     writing to the same pipe simultaneously, output from different
     processes might be interleaved in chunks of this size.  *Note
     Pipes and FIFOs::.

   These are alternative macro names for some of the same information.

 -- Macro: int MAXNAMLEN
     This is the BSD name for `NAME_MAX'.  It is defined in `dirent.h'.

 -- Macro: int FILENAME_MAX
     The value of this macro is an integer constant expression that
     represents the maximum length of a file name string.  It is
     defined in `stdio.h'.

     Unlike `PATH_MAX', this macro is defined even if there is no actual
     limit imposed.  In such a case, its value is typically a very large
     number.  *This is always the case on GNU/Hurd systems.*

     *Usage Note:* Don't use `FILENAME_MAX' as the size of an array in
     which to store a file name!  You can't possibly make an array that
     big!  Use dynamic allocation (*note Memory Allocation::) instead.

32.7 Optional Features in File Support
======================================

POSIX defines certain system-specific options in the system calls for
operating on files.  Some systems support these options and others do
not.  Since these options are provided in the kernel, not in the
library, simply using the GNU C Library does not guarantee that any of
these features is supported; it depends on the system you are using.
They can also vary between file systems on a single machine.

   This section describes the macros you can test to determine whether a
particular option is supported on your machine.  If a given macro is
defined in `unistd.h', then its value says whether the corresponding
feature is supported.  (A value of `-1' indicates no; any other value
indicates yes.)  If the macro is undefined, it means particular files
may or may not support the feature.

   Since all the machines that support the GNU C Library also support
NFS, one can never make a general statement about whether all file
systems support the `_POSIX_CHOWN_RESTRICTED' and `_POSIX_NO_TRUNC'
features.  So these names are never defined as macros in the GNU C
Library.

 -- Macro: int _POSIX_CHOWN_RESTRICTED
     If this option is in effect, the `chown' function is restricted so
     that the only changes permitted to nonprivileged processes is to
     change the group owner of a file to either be the effective group
     ID of the process, or one of its supplementary group IDs.  *Note
     File Owner::.

 -- Macro: int _POSIX_NO_TRUNC
     If this option is in effect, file name components longer than
     `NAME_MAX' generate an `ENAMETOOLONG' error.  Otherwise, file name
     components that are too long are silently truncated.

 -- Macro: unsigned char _POSIX_VDISABLE
     This option is only meaningful for files that are terminal devices.
     If it is enabled, then handling for special control characters can
     be disabled individually.  *Note Special Characters::.

   If one of these macros is undefined, that means that the option
might be in effect for some files and not for others.  To inquire about
a particular file, call `pathconf' or `fpathconf'.  *Note Pathconf::.

32.8 Minimum Values for File System Limits
==========================================

Here are the names for the POSIX minimum upper bounds for some of the
above parameters.  The significance of these values is that you can
safely push to these limits without checking whether the particular
system you are using can go that far.  In most cases GNU systems do not
have these strict limitations.  The actual limit should be requested if
necessary.

`_POSIX_LINK_MAX'
     The most restrictive limit permitted by POSIX for the maximum
     value of a file's link count.  The value of this constant is `8';
     thus, you can always make up to eight names for a file without
     running into a system limit.

`_POSIX_MAX_CANON'
     The most restrictive limit permitted by POSIX for the maximum
     number of bytes in a canonical input line from a terminal device.
     The value of this constant is `255'.

`_POSIX_MAX_INPUT'
     The most restrictive limit permitted by POSIX for the maximum
     number of bytes in a terminal device input queue (or typeahead
     buffer).  *Note Input Modes::.  The value of this constant is
     `255'.

`_POSIX_NAME_MAX'
     The most restrictive limit permitted by POSIX for the maximum
     number of bytes in a file name component.  The value of this
     constant is `14'.

`_POSIX_PATH_MAX'
     The most restrictive limit permitted by POSIX for the maximum
     number of bytes in a file name.  The value of this constant is
     `256'.

`_POSIX_PIPE_BUF'
     The most restrictive limit permitted by POSIX for the maximum
     number of bytes that can be written atomically to a pipe.  The
     value of this constant is `512'.

`SYMLINK_MAX'
     Maximum number of bytes in a symbolic link.

`POSIX_REC_INCR_XFER_SIZE'
     Recommended increment for file transfer sizes between the
     `POSIX_REC_MIN_XFER_SIZE' and `POSIX_REC_MAX_XFER_SIZE' values.

`POSIX_REC_MAX_XFER_SIZE'
     Maximum recommended file transfer size.

`POSIX_REC_MIN_XFER_SIZE'
     Minimum recommended file transfer size.

`POSIX_REC_XFER_ALIGN'
     Recommended file transfer buffer alignment.

32.9 Using `pathconf'
=====================

When your machine allows different files to have different values for a
file system parameter, you can use the functions in this section to find
out the value that applies to any particular file.

   These functions and the associated constants for the PARAMETER
argument are declared in the header file `unistd.h'.

 -- Function: long int pathconf (const char *FILENAME, int PARAMETER)
     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Unsafe lock heap | AC-Unsafe lock fd
     mem | *Note POSIX Safety Concepts::.

     This function is used to inquire about the limits that apply to
     the file named FILENAME.

     The PARAMETER argument should be one of the `_PC_' constants
     listed below.

     The normal return value from `pathconf' is the value you requested.
     A value of `-1' is returned both if the implementation does not
     impose a limit, and in case of an error.  In the former case,
     `errno' is not set, while in the latter case, `errno' is set to
     indicate the cause of the problem.  So the only way to use this
     function robustly is to store `0' into `errno' just before calling
     it.

     Besides the usual file name errors (*note File Name Errors::), the
     following error condition is defined for this function:

    `EINVAL'
          The value of PARAMETER is invalid, or the implementation
          doesn't support the PARAMETER for the specific file.

 -- Function: long int fpathconf (int FILEDES, int PARAMETER)
     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Unsafe lock heap | AC-Unsafe lock fd
     mem | *Note POSIX Safety Concepts::.

     This is just like `pathconf' except that an open file descriptor
     is used to specify the file for which information is requested,
     instead of a file name.

     The following `errno' error conditions are defined for this
     function:

    `EBADF'
          The FILEDES argument is not a valid file descriptor.

    `EINVAL'
          The value of PARAMETER is invalid, or the implementation
          doesn't support the PARAMETER for the specific file.

   Here are the symbolic constants that you can use as the PARAMETER
argument to `pathconf' and `fpathconf'.  The values are all integer
constants.

`_PC_LINK_MAX'
     Inquire about the value of `LINK_MAX'.

`_PC_MAX_CANON'
     Inquire about the value of `MAX_CANON'.

`_PC_PRIO_IO'
     Inquire about the value of `_POSIX_PRIO_IO'.

     Inquire about the availability of large files on the filesystem.

`_PC_REC_INCR_XFER_SIZE'
     Inquire about the value of `POSIX_REC_INCR_XFER_SIZE'.

`_PC_REC_MAX_XFER_SIZE'
     Inquire about the value of `POSIX_REC_MAX_XFER_SIZE'.

`_PC_REC_MIN_XFER_SIZE'
     Inquire about the value of `POSIX_REC_MIN_XFER_SIZE'.

`_PC_REC_XFER_ALIGN'
     Inquire about the value of `POSIX_REC_XFER_ALIGN'.

   *Portability Note:* On some systems, the GNU C Library does not
enforce `_PC_NAME_MAX' or `_PC_PATH_MAX' limits.

32.10 Utility Program Capacity Limits
=====================================

The POSIX.2 standard specifies certain system limits that you can access
through `sysconf' that apply to utility behavior rather than the
behavior of the library or the operating system.

   The GNU C Library defines macros for these limits, and `sysconf'
returns values for them if you ask; but these values convey no
meaningful information.  They are simply the smallest values that
POSIX.2 permits.

 -- Macro: int BC_BASE_MAX
     The largest value of `obase' that the `bc' utility is guaranteed
     to support.

32.12 String-Valued Parameters
==============================

POSIX.2 defines a way to get string-valued parameters from the operating
system with the function `confstr':

 -- Function: size_t confstr (int PARAMETER, char *BUF, size_t LEN)
     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Safe | AC-Safe | *Note POSIX Safety
     Concepts::.

     This function reads the value of a string-valued system parameter,
     storing the string into LEN bytes of memory space starting at BUF.
     The PARAMETER argument should be one of the `_CS_' symbols listed
     below.

     The normal return value from `confstr' is the length of the string
     value that you asked for.  If you supply a null pointer for BUF,
     then `confstr' does not try to store the string; it just returns
     its length.  A value of `0' indicates an error.

     If the string you asked for is too long for the buffer (that is,
     longer than `LEN - 1'), then `confstr' stores just that much
     (leaving room for the terminating null character).  You can tell
     that this has happened because `confstr' returns a value greater
     than or equal to LEN.

     The following `errno' error conditions are defined for this
     function:

    `EINVAL'
          The value of the PARAMETER is invalid.

   Currently there is just one parameter you can read with `confstr':

`_CS_PATH'
     This parameter's value is the recommended default path for
     searching for executable files.  This is the path that a user has
     by default just after logging in.

`_CS_LFS_CFLAGS'
     The returned string specifies which additional flags must be given
     to the C compiler if a source is compiled using the
     `_LARGEFILE_SOURCE' feature select macro; *note Feature Test
     Macros::.

`_CS_LFS_LDFLAGS'
     The returned string specifies which additional flags must be given
     to the linker if a source is compiled using the
     `_LARGEFILE_SOURCE' feature select macro; *note Feature Test
     Macros::.

`_CS_LFS_LIBS'
     The returned string specifies which additional libraries must be
     linked to the application if a source is compiled using the
     `_LARGEFILE_SOURCE' feature select macro; *note Feature Test
     Macros::.

`_CS_LFS_LINTFLAGS'
     The returned string specifies which additional flags must be given
     to the lint tool if a source is compiled using the
     `_LARGEFILE_SOURCE' feature select macro; *note Feature Test
     Macros::.

`_CS_LFS64_CFLAGS'
     The returned string specifies which additional flags must be given
     to the C compiler if a source is compiled using the
     `_LARGEFILE64_SOURCE' feature select macro; *note Feature Test
     Macros::.

`_CS_LFS64_LDFLAGS'
     The returned string specifies which additional flags must be given
     to the linker if a source is compiled using the
     `_LARGEFILE64_SOURCE' feature select macro; *note Feature Test
     Macros::.

`_CS_LFS64_LIBS'
     The returned string specifies which additional libraries must be
     linked to the application if a source is compiled using the
     `_LARGEFILE64_SOURCE' feature select macro; *note Feature Test
     Macros::.

`_CS_LFS64_LINTFLAGS'
     The returned string specifies which additional flags must be given
     to the lint tool if a source is compiled using the
     `_LARGEFILE64_SOURCE' feature select macro; *note Feature Test
     Macros::.

   The way to use `confstr' without any arbitrary limit on string size
is to call it twice: first call it to get the length, allocate the
buffer accordingly, and then call `confstr' again to fill the buffer,
like this:

     char *
     get_default_path (void)
     {
       size_t len = confstr (_CS_PATH, NULL, 0);
       char *buffer = (char *) xmalloc (len);

       if (confstr (_CS_PATH, buf, len + 1) == 0)
         {
           free (buffer);
           return NULL;
         }

       return buffer;
     }

33 DES Encryption and Password Handling
***************************************

On many systems, it is unnecessary to have any kind of user
authentication; for instance, a workstation which is not connected to a
network probably does not need any user authentication, because to use
the machine an intruder must have physical access.

   Sometimes, however, it is necessary to be sure that a user is
authorized to use some service a machine provides--for instance, to log
in as a particular user id (*note Users and Groups::).  One traditional
way of doing this is for each user to choose a secret "password"; then,
the system can ask someone claiming to be a user what the user's
password is, and if the person gives the correct password then the
system can grant the appropriate privileges.

   If all the passwords are just stored in a file somewhere, then this
file has to be very carefully protected.  To avoid this, passwords are
run through a "one-way function", a function which makes it difficult to
work out what its input was by looking at its output, before storing in
the file.

   The GNU C Library provides a one-way function that is compatible with
the behavior of the `crypt' function introduced in FreeBSD 2.0.  It
supports two one-way algorithms: one based on the MD5 message-digest
algorithm that is compatible with modern BSD systems, and the other
based on the Data Encryption Standard (DES) that is compatible with
Unix systems.

   It also provides support for Secure RPC, and some library functions
that can be used to perform normal DES encryption.  The `AUTH_DES'
authentication flavor in Secure RPC, as provided by the GNU C Library,
uses DES and does not comply with FIPS 140-2 nor does any other use of
DES within the GNU C Library.  It is recommended that Secure RPC should
not be used for systems that need to comply with FIPS 140-2 since all
flavors of encrypted authentication use normal DES.

33.1 Legal Problems
===================

Because of the continuously changing state of the law, it's not possible
to provide a definitive survey of the laws affecting cryptography.
Instead, this section warns you of some of the known trouble spots; this
may help you when you try to find out what the laws of your country are.

   Some countries require that you have a license to use, possess, or
import cryptography.  These countries are believed to include
Byelorussia, Burma, India, Indonesia, Israel, Kazakhstan, Pakistan,
Russia, and Saudi Arabia.

   Some countries restrict the transmission of encrypted messages by
radio; some telecommunications carriers restrict the transmission of
encrypted messages over their network.

   Many countries have some form of export control for encryption
software.  The Wassenaar Arrangement is a multilateral agreement
between 33 countries (Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria,
Canada, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece,
Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, New
Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, the Republic of Korea, Romania, the
Russian Federation, the Slovak Republic, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland,
Turkey, Ukraine, the United Kingdom and the United States) which
restricts some kinds of encryption exports.  Different countries apply
the arrangement in different ways; some do not allow the exception for
certain kinds of "public domain" software (which would include this
library), some only restrict the export of software in tangible form,
and others impose significant additional restrictions.

   The United States has additional rules.  This software would
generally be exportable under 15 CFR 740.13(e), which permits exports of
"encryption source code" which is "publicly available" and which is
"not subject to an express agreement for the payment of a licensing fee
or royalty for commercial production or sale of any product developed
with the source code" to most countries.

   The rules in this area are continuously changing.  If you know of any
information in this manual that is out-of-date, please report it to the
bug database.  *Note Reporting Bugs::.

33.2 Reading Passwords
======================

When reading in a password, it is desirable to avoid displaying it on
the screen, to help keep it secret.  The following function handles this
in a convenient way.

 -- Function: char * getpass (const char *PROMPT)
     Preliminary: | MT-Unsafe term | AS-Unsafe heap lock corrupt |
     AC-Unsafe term lock corrupt | *Note POSIX Safety Concepts::.

     `getpass' outputs PROMPT, then reads a string in from the terminal
     without echoing it.  It tries to connect to the real terminal,
     `/dev/tty', if possible, to encourage users not to put plaintext
     passwords in files; otherwise, it uses `stdin' and `stderr'.
     `getpass' also disables the INTR, QUIT, and SUSP characters on the
     terminal using the `ISIG' terminal attribute (*note Local Modes::).
     The terminal is flushed before and after `getpass', so that
     characters of a mistyped password are not accidentally visible.

     In other C libraries, `getpass' may only return the first
     `PASS_MAX' bytes of a password.  The GNU C Library has no limit, so
     `PASS_MAX' is undefined.

     The prototype for this function is in `unistd.h'.  `PASS_MAX'
     would be defined in `limits.h'.

   This precise set of operations may not suit all possible situations.
In this case, it is recommended that users write their own `getpass'
substitute.  For instance, a very simple substitute is as follows:


     #include <termios.h>
     #include <stdio.h>

     ssize_t
     my_getpass (char **lineptr, size_t *n, FILE *stream)
     {
       struct termios old, new;
       int nread;

       /* Turn echoing off and fail if we can't. */
       if (tcgetattr (fileno (stream), &old) != 0)
         return -1;
       new = old;
       new.c_lflag &= ~ECHO;
       if (tcsetattr (fileno (stream), TCSAFLUSH, &new) != 0)
         return -1;

       /* Read the password. */
       nread = getline (lineptr, n, stream);

       /* Restore terminal. */
       (void) tcsetattr (fileno (stream), TCSAFLUSH, &old);

       return nread;
     }

   The substitute takes the same parameters as `getline' (*note Line
Input::); the user must print any prompt desired.

33.3 Encrypting Passwords
=========================

 -- Function: char * crypt (const char *KEY, const char *SALT)
     Preliminary: | MT-Unsafe race:crypt | AS-Unsafe corrupt lock heap
     dlopen | AC-Unsafe lock mem | *Note POSIX Safety Concepts::.

     The `crypt' function takes a password, KEY, as a string, and a
     SALT character array which is described below, and returns a
     printable ASCII string which starts with another salt.  It is
     believed that, given the output of the function, the best way to
     find a KEY that will produce that output is to guess values of KEY
     until the original value of KEY is found.

     The SALT parameter does two things.  Firstly, it selects which
     algorithm is used, the MD5-based one or the DES-based one.
     Secondly, it makes life harder for someone trying to guess
     passwords against a file containing many passwords; without a
     SALT, an intruder can make a guess, run `crypt' on it once, and
     compare the result with all the passwords.  With a SALT, the
     intruder must run `crypt' once for each different salt.

     For the MD5-based algorithm, the SALT should consist of the string
     `$1$', followed by up to 8 characters, terminated by either
     another `$' or the end of the string.  The result of `crypt' will
     be the SALT, followed by a `$' if the salt didn't end with one,
     followed by 22 characters from the alphabet `./0-9A-Za-z', up to
     34 characters total.  Every character in the KEY is significant.

     For the DES-based algorithm, the SALT should consist of two
     characters from the alphabet `./0-9A-Za-z', and the result of
     `crypt' will be those two characters followed by 11 more from the
     same alphabet, 13 in total.  Only the first 8 characters in the
     KEY are significant.

     The MD5-based algorithm has no limit on the useful length of the
     password used, and is slightly more secure.  It is therefore
     preferred over the DES-based algorithm.

     When the user enters their password for the first time, the SALT
     should be set to a new string which is reasonably random.  To
     verify a password against the result of a previous call to
     `crypt', pass the result of the previous call as the SALT.

   The following short program is an example of how to use `crypt' the
first time a password is entered.  Note that the SALT generation is
just barely acceptable; in particular, it is not unique between
machines, and in many applications it would not be acceptable to let an
attacker know what time the user's password was last set.


     #include <stdio.h>
     #include <time.h>
     #include <unistd.h>
     #include <crypt.h>

     int
     main(void)
     {
       unsigned long seed[2];
       char salt[] = "$1$........";
       const char *const seedchars =
         "./0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRST"
         "UVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz";
       char *password;
       int i;

       /* Generate a (not very) random seed.
          You should do it better than this... */
       seed[0] = time(NULL);
       seed[1] = getpid() ^ (seed[0] >> 14 & 0x30000);

       /* Turn it into printable characters from `seedchars'. */
       for (i = 0; i < 8; i++)
         salt[3+i] = seedchars[(seed[i/5] >> (i%5)*6) & 0x3f];

       /* Read in the user's password and encrypt it. */
       password = crypt(getpass("Password:"), salt);

       /* Print the results. */
       puts(password);
       return 0;
     }

   The next program shows how to verify a password.  It prompts the user
for a password and prints "Access granted." if the user types `GNU libc
manual'.


     #include <stdio.h>
     #include <string.h>
     #include <unistd.h>
     #include <crypt.h>

     int
     main(void)
     {
       /* Hashed form of "GNU libc manual". */
       const char *const pass = "$1$/iSaq7rB$EoUw5jJPPvAPECNaaWzMK/";

       char *result;
       int ok;

       /* Read in the user's password and encrypt it,
          passing the expected password in as the salt. */
       result = crypt(getpass("Password:"), pass);

       /* Test the result. */
       ok = strcmp (result, pass) == 0;

       puts(ok ? "Access granted." : "Access denied.");
       return ok ? 0 : 1;
     }

 -- Function: char * crypt_r (const char *KEY, const char *SALT, struct
          crypt_data * DATA)
     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Unsafe corrupt lock heap dlopen |
     AC-Unsafe lock mem | *Note POSIX Safety Concepts::.

     The `crypt_r' function does the same thing as `crypt', but takes
     an extra parameter which includes space for its result (among
     other things), so it can be reentrant.  `data->initialized' must be
     cleared to zero before the first time `crypt_r' is called.

     The `crypt_r' function is a GNU extension.

   The `crypt' and `crypt_r' functions are prototyped in the header
`crypt.h'.

33.4 DES Encryption
===================

The Data Encryption Standard is described in the US Government Federal
Information Processing Standards (FIPS) 46-3 published by the National
Institute of Standards and Technology.  The DES has been very thoroughly
analyzed since it was developed in the late 1970s, and no new
significant flaws have been found.

   However, the DES uses only a 56-bit key (plus 8 parity bits), and a
machine has been built in 1998 which can search through all possible
keys in about 6 days, which cost about US$200000; faster searches would
be possible with more money.  This makes simple DES insecure for most
purposes, and NIST no longer permits new US government systems to use
simple DES.

   For serious encryption functionality, it is recommended that one of
the many free encryption libraries be used instead of these routines.

   The DES is a reversible operation which takes a 64-bit block and a
64-bit key, and produces another 64-bit block.  Usually the bits are
numbered so that the most-significant bit, the first bit, of each block
is numbered 1.

   Under that numbering, every 8th bit of the key (the 8th, 16th, and so
on) is not used by the encryption algorithm itself.  But the key must
have odd parity; that is, out of bits 1 through 8, and 9 through 16, and
so on, there must be an odd number of `1' bits, and this completely
specifies the unused bits.

 -- Function: void setkey (const char *KEY)
     Preliminary: | MT-Unsafe race:crypt | AS-Unsafe corrupt lock |
     AC-Unsafe lock | *Note POSIX Safety Concepts::.

     The `setkey' function sets an internal data structure to be an
     expanded form of KEY.  KEY is specified as an array of 64 bits
     each stored in a `char', the first bit is `key[0]' and the 64th
     bit is `key[63]'.  The KEY should have the correct parity.

 -- Function: void encrypt (char *BLOCK, int EDFLAG)
     Preliminary: | MT-Unsafe race:crypt | AS-Unsafe corrupt lock |
     AC-Unsafe lock | *Note POSIX Safety Concepts::.

     The `encrypt' function encrypts BLOCK if EDFLAG is 0, otherwise it
     decrypts BLOCK, using a key previously set by `setkey'.  The
     result is placed in BLOCK.

     Like `setkey', BLOCK is specified as an array of 64 bits each
     stored in a `char', but there are no parity bits in BLOCK.

 -- Function: void setkey_r (const char *KEY, struct crypt_data * DATA)
 -- Function: void encrypt_r (char *BLOCK, int EDFLAG, struct
          crypt_data * DATA)
     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Unsafe corrupt lock | AC-Unsafe lock |
     *Note POSIX Safety Concepts::.

     These are reentrant versions of `setkey' and `encrypt'.  The only
     difference is the extra parameter, which stores the expanded
     version of KEY.  Before calling `setkey_r' the first time,
     `data->initialized' must be cleared to zero.

   The `setkey_r' and `encrypt_r' functions are GNU extensions.
`setkey', `encrypt', `setkey_r', and `encrypt_r' are defined in
`crypt.h'.

 -- Function: int ecb_crypt (char *KEY, char *BLOCKS, unsigned int LEN,
          unsigned int MODE)
     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Safe | AC-Safe | *Note POSIX Safety
     Concepts::.

     The function `ecb_crypt' encrypts or decrypts one or more blocks
     using DES.  Each block is encrypted independently.

     The BLOCKS and the KEY are stored packed in 8-bit bytes, so that
     the first bit of the key is the most-significant bit of `key[0]'
     and the 63rd bit of the key is stored as the least-significant bit
     of `key[7]'.  The KEY should have the correct parity.

     LEN is the number of bytes in BLOCKS.  It should be a multiple of
     8 (so that there are a whole number of blocks to encrypt).  LEN is
     limited to a maximum of `DES_MAXDATA' bytes.

     The result of the encryption replaces the input in BLOCKS.

     The MODE parameter is the bitwise OR of two of the following:

    `DES_ENCRYPT'
          This constant, used in the MODE parameter, specifies that
          BLOCKS is to be encrypted.

    `DES_DECRYPT'
          This constant, used in the MODE parameter, specifies that
          BLOCKS is to be decrypted.

    `DES_HW'
          This constant, used in the MODE parameter, asks to use a
          hardware device.  If no hardware device is available,
          encryption happens anyway, but in software.

    `DES_SW'
          This constant, used in the MODE parameter, specifies that no
          hardware device is to be used.

     The result of the function will be one of these values:

    `DESERR_NONE'
          The encryption succeeded.

    `DESERR_NOHWDEVICE'
          The encryption succeeded, but there was no hardware device
          available.

    `DESERR_HWERROR'
          The encryption failed because of a hardware problem.

    `DESERR_BADPARAM'
          The encryption failed because of a bad parameter, for
          instance LEN is not a multiple of 8 or LEN is larger than
          `DES_MAXDATA'.

 -- Function: int DES_FAILED (int ERR)
     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Safe | AC-Safe | *Note POSIX Safety
     Concepts::.

     This macro returns 1 if ERR is a `success' result code from
     `ecb_crypt' or `cbc_crypt', and 0 otherwise.

 -- Function: int cbc_crypt (char *KEY, char *BLOCKS, unsigned int LEN,
          unsigned int MODE, char *IVEC)
     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Safe | AC-Safe | *Note POSIX Safety
     Concepts::.

     The function `cbc_crypt' encrypts or decrypts one or more blocks
     using DES in Cipher Block Chaining mode.

     For encryption in CBC mode, each block is exclusive-ored with IVEC
     before being encrypted, then IVEC is replaced with the result of
     the encryption, then the next block is processed.  Decryption is
     the reverse of this process.

     This has the advantage that blocks which are the same before being
     encrypted are very unlikely to be the same after being encrypted,
     making it much harder to detect patterns in the data.

     Usually, IVEC is set to 8 random bytes before encryption starts.
     Then the 8 random bytes are transmitted along with the encrypted
     data (without themselves being encrypted), and passed back in as
     IVEC for decryption.  Another possibility is to set IVEC to 8
     zeroes initially, and have the first block encrypted consist of 8
     random bytes.

     Otherwise, all the parameters are similar to those for `ecb_crypt'.

 -- Function: void des_setparity (char *KEY)
     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Safe | AC-Safe | *Note POSIX Safety
     Concepts::.

     The function `des_setparity' changes the 64-bit KEY, stored packed
     in 8-bit bytes, to have odd parity by altering the low bits of
     each byte.

   The `ecb_crypt', `cbc_crypt', and `des_setparity' functions and
their accompanying macros are all defined in the header
`rpc/des_crypt.h'.

33.5 Generating Unpredictable Bytes
===================================

Some cryptographic applications (such as session key generation) need
unpredictable bytes.

   In general, application code should use a deterministic random bit
generator, which could call the `getentropy' function described below
internally to obtain randomness to seed the generator.  The `getrandom'
function is intended for low-level applications which need additional
control over the blocking behavior.

 -- Function: int getentropy (void *BUFFER, size_t LENGTH)
     | MT-Safe | AS-Safe | AC-Safe | *Note POSIX Safety Concepts::.

     This function writes LENGTH bytes of random data to the array
     starting at BUFFER, which must be at most 256 bytes long.  The
     function returns zero on success.  On failure, it returns `-1' and
     `errno' is updated accordingly.

     The `getentropy' function is declared in the header file
     `sys/random.h'.  It is derived from OpenBSD.

     The `getentropy' function is not a cancellation point.  A call to
     `getentropy' can block if the system has just booted and the kernel
     entropy pool has not yet been initialized.  In this case, the
     function will keep blocking even if a signal arrives, and return
     only after the entropy pool has been initialized.

     The `getentropy' function can fail with several errors, some of
     which are listed below.

    `ENOSYS'
          The kernel does not implement the required system call.

    `EFAULT'
          The combination of BUFFER and LENGTH arguments specifies an
          invalid memory range.

    `EIO'
          More than 256 bytes of randomness have been requested, or the
          buffer could not be overwritten with random data for an
          unspecified reason.



 -- Function: ssize_t getrandom (void *BUFFER, size_t LENGTH, unsigned
          int FLAGS)
     | MT-Safe | AS-Safe | AC-Safe | *Note POSIX Safety Concepts::.

     This function writes LENGTH bytes of random data to the array
     starting at BUFFER.  On success, this function returns the number
     of bytes which have been written to the buffer (which can be less
     than LENGTH).  On error, `-1' is returned, and `errno' is updated
     accordingly.

     The `getrandom' function is declared in the header file
     `sys/random.h'.  It is a GNU extension.

     The following flags are defined for the FLAGS argument:

    `GRND_RANDOM'
          Use the `/dev/random' (blocking) pool instead of the
          `/dev/urandom' (non-blocking) pool to obtain randomness.  If
          the `GRND_RANDOM' flag is specified, the `getrandom' function
          can block even after the randomness source has been
          initialized.

    `GRND_NONBLOCK'
          Instead of blocking, return to the caller immediately if no
          data is available.

     The `getrandom' function is a cancellation point.

     Obtaining randomness from the `/dev/urandom' pool (i.e., a call
     without the `GRND_RANDOM' flag) can block if the system has just
     booted and the pool has not yet been initialized.

     The `getrandom' function can fail with several errors, some of
     which are listed below.  In addition, the function may not fill the
     buffer completely and return a value less than LENGTH.

    `ENOSYS'
          The kernel does not implement the `getrandom' system call.

    `EAGAIN'
          No random data was available and `GRND_NONBLOCK' was
          specified in FLAGS.

    `EFAULT'
          The combination of BUFFER and LENGTH arguments specifies an
          invalid memory range.

    `EINTR'
          The system call was interrupted.  During the system boot
          process, before the kernel randomness pool is initialized,
          this can happen even if FLAGS is zero.

    `EINVAL'
          The FLAGS argument contains an invalid combination of flags.

34 Debugging support
********************

Applications are usually debugged using dedicated debugger programs.
But sometimes this is not possible and, in any case, it is useful to
provide the developer with as much information as possible at the time
the problems are experienced.  For this reason a few functions are
provided which a program can use to help the developer more easily
locate the problem.

* Menu:

* Backtraces::                Obtaining and printing a back trace of the
                               current stack.


File: libc.info,  Node: Backtraces,  Up: Debugging Support

34.1 Backtraces
===============

A "backtrace" is a list of the function calls that are currently active
in a thread.  The usual way to inspect a backtrace of a program is to
use an external debugger such as gdb.  However, sometimes it is useful
to obtain a backtrace programmatically from within a program, e.g., for
the purposes of logging or diagnostics.

   The header file `execinfo.h' declares three functions that obtain
and manipulate backtraces of the current thread.  

 -- Function: int backtrace (void **BUFFER, int SIZE)
     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Unsafe init heap dlopen plugin lock |
     AC-Unsafe init mem lock fd | *Note POSIX Safety Concepts::.

     The `backtrace' function obtains a backtrace for the current
     thread, as a list of pointers, and places the information into
     BUFFER.  The argument SIZE should be the number of `void *'
     elements that will fit into BUFFER.  The return value is the
     actual number of entries of BUFFER that are obtained, and is at
     most SIZE.

     The pointers placed in BUFFER are actually return addresses
     obtained by inspecting the stack, one return address per stack
     frame.

     Note that certain compiler optimizations may interfere with
     obtaining a valid backtrace.  Function inlining causes the inlined
     function to not have a stack frame; tail call optimization
     replaces one stack frame with another; frame pointer elimination
     will stop `backtrace' from interpreting the stack contents
     correctly.

 -- Function: char ** backtrace_symbols (void *const *BUFFER, int SIZE)
     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Unsafe heap | AC-Unsafe mem lock |
     *Note POSIX Safety Concepts::.

     The `backtrace_symbols' function translates the information
     obtained from the `backtrace' function into an array of strings.
     The argument BUFFER should be a pointer to an array of addresses
     obtained via the `backtrace' function, and SIZE is the number of
     entries in that array (the return value of `backtrace').

     The return value is a pointer to an array of strings, which has
     SIZE entries just like the array BUFFER.  Each string contains a
     printable representation of the corresponding element of BUFFER.
     It includes the function name (if this can be determined), an
     offset into the function, and the actual return address (in
     hexadecimal).

     Currently, the function name and offset can only be obtained on
     systems that use the ELF binary format for programs and libraries.
     On other systems, only the hexadecimal return address will be
     present.  Also, you may need to pass additional flags to the
     linker to make the function names available to the program.  (For
     example, on systems using GNU ld, you must pass `-rdynamic'.)

     The return value of `backtrace_symbols' is a pointer obtained via
     the `malloc' function, and it is the responsibility of the caller
     to `free' that pointer.  Note that only the return value need be
     freed, not the individual strings.

     The return value is `NULL' if sufficient memory for the strings
     cannot be obtained.

 -- Function: void backtrace_symbols_fd (void *const *BUFFER, int SIZE,
          int FD)
     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Safe | AC-Unsafe lock | *Note POSIX
     Safety Concepts::.

     The `backtrace_symbols_fd' function performs the same translation
     as the function `backtrace_symbols' function.  Instead of returning
     the strings to the caller, it writes the strings to the file
     descriptor FD, one per line.  It does not use the `malloc'
     function, and can therefore be used in situations where that
     function might fail.

   The following program illustrates the use of these functions.  Note
that the array to contain the return addresses returned by `backtrace'
is allocated on the stack.  Therefore code like this can be used in
situations where the memory handling via `malloc' does not work anymore
(in which case the `backtrace_symbols' has to be replaced by a
`backtrace_symbols_fd' call as well).  The number of return addresses
is normally not very large.  Even complicated programs rather seldom
have a nesting level of more than, say, 50 and with 200 possible
entries probably all programs should be covered.


     #include <execinfo.h>
     #include <stdio.h>
     #include <stdlib.h>

     /* Obtain a backtrace and print it to `stdout'. */
     void
     print_trace (void)
     {
       void *array[10];
       size_t size;
       char **strings;
       size_t i;

       size = backtrace (array, 10);
       strings = backtrace_symbols (array, size);

       printf ("Obtained %zd stack frames.\n", size);

       for (i = 0; i < size; i++)
          printf ("%s\n", strings[i]);

       free (strings);
     }

     /* A dummy function to make the backtrace more interesting. */
     void
     dummy_function (void)
     {
       print_trace ();
     }

     int
     main (void)
     {
       dummy_function ();
       return 0;
     }

35 POSIX Threads
****************

This chapter describes the GNU C Library POSIX Threads implementation.

* Menu:

* Thread-specific Data::          Support for creating and
				  managing thread-specific data
* Non-POSIX Extensions::          Additional functions to extend
				  POSIX Thread functionality


File: libc.info,  Node: Thread-specific Data,  Next: Non-POSIX Extensions,  Up: POSIX Threads

35.1 Thread-specific Data
=========================

The GNU C Library implements functions to allow users to create and
manage data specific to a thread.  Such data may be destroyed at thread
exit, if a destructor is provided.  The following functions are defined:

 -- Function: int pthread_key_create (pthread_key_t *KEY, void
          (*DESTRUCTOR)(void*))
     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Safe | AC-Safe | *Note POSIX Safety
     Concepts::.

     Create a thread-specific data key for the calling thread,
     referenced by KEY.

     Objects declared with the C++11 `thread_local' keyword are
     destroyed before thread-specific data, so they should not be used
     in thread-specific data destructors or even as members of the
     thread-specific data, since the latter is passed as an argument to
     the destructor function.

 -- Function: int pthread_key_delete (pthread_key_t KEY)
     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Safe | AC-Safe | *Note POSIX Safety
     Concepts::.

     Destroy the thread-specific data KEY in the calling thread.  The
     destructor for the thread-specific data is not called during
     destruction, nor is it called during thread exit.

 -- Function: void *pthread_getspecific (pthread_key_t KEY)
     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Safe | AC-Safe | *Note POSIX Safety
     Concepts::.

     Return the thread-specific data associated with KEY in the calling
     thread.

 -- Function: int pthread_setspecific (pthread_key_t KEY, const void
          *VALUE)
     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Unsafe corrupt heap | AC-Unsafe
     corrupt mem | *Note POSIX Safety Concepts::.

     Associate the thread-specific VALUE with KEY in the calling thread.

35.2 Non-POSIX Extensions
=========================

In addition to implementing the POSIX API for threads, the GNU C
Library provides additional functions and interfaces to provide
functionality not specified in the standard.

* Menu:

* Default Thread Attributes::             Setting default attributes for
					  threads in a process.


File: libc.info,  Node: Default Thread Attributes,  Up: Non-POSIX Extensions

35.2.1 Setting Process-wide defaults for thread attributes
----------------------------------------------------------

The GNU C Library provides non-standard API functions to set and get
the default attributes used in the creation of threads in a process.

 -- Function: int pthread_getattr_default_np (pthread_attr_t *ATTR)
     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Unsafe lock | AC-Unsafe lock | *Note
     POSIX Safety Concepts::.

     Get the default attribute values and set ATTR to match.  This
     function returns 0 on success and a non-zero error code on failure.

 -- Function: int pthread_setattr_default_np (pthread_attr_t *ATTR)
     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Unsafe heap lock | AC-Unsafe lock mem
     | *Note POSIX Safety Concepts::.

     Set the default attribute values to match the values in ATTR.  The
     function returns 0 on success and a non-zero error code on failure.
     The following error codes are defined for this function:

    `EINVAL'
          At least one of the values in ATTR does not qualify as valid
          for the attributes or the stack address is set in the
          attribute.

    `ENOMEM'
          The system does not have sufficient memory.

36 Internal probes
******************

In order to aid in debugging and monitoring internal behavior, the GNU
C Library exposes nearly-zero-overhead SystemTap probes marked with the
`libc' provider.

   These probes are not part of the GNU C Library stable ABI, and they
are subject to change or removal across releases.  Our only promise with
regard to them is that, if we find a need to remove or modify the
arguments of a probe, the modified probe will have a different name, so
that program monitors relying on the old probe will not get unexpected
arguments.

File: libc.info,  Node: Memory Allocation Probes,  Next: Mathematical Function Probes,  Up: Internal Probes

36.1 Memory Allocation Probes
=============================

These probes are designed to signal relatively unusual situations within
the virtual memory subsystem of the GNU C Library.

 -- Probe: memory_sbrk_more (void *$ARG1, size_t $ARG2)
     This probe is triggered after the main arena is extended by calling
     `sbrk'.  Argument $ARG1 is the additional size requested to
     `sbrk', and $ARG2 is the pointer that marks the end of the `sbrk'
     area, returned in response to the request.

 -- Probe: memory_sbrk_less (void *$ARG1, size_t $ARG2)
     This probe is triggered after the size of the main arena is
     decreased by calling `sbrk'.  Argument $ARG1 is the size released
     by `sbrk' (the positive value, rather than the negative value
     passed to `sbrk'), and $ARG2 is the pointer that marks the end of
     the `sbrk' area, returned in response to the request.

 -- Probe: memory_heap_new (void *$ARG1, size_t $ARG2)
     This probe is triggered after a new heap is `mmap'ed.  Argument
     $ARG1 is a pointer to the base of the memory area, where the
     `heap_info' data structure is held, and $ARG2 is the size of the
     heap.

 -- Probe: memory_heap_free (void *$ARG1, size_t $ARG2)
     This probe is triggered _before_ (unlike the other sbrk and heap
     probes) a heap is completely removed via `munmap'.  Argument $ARG1
     is a pointer to the heap, and $ARG2 is the size of the heap.

 -- Probe: memory_heap_more (void *$ARG1, size_t $ARG2)
     This probe is triggered after a trailing portion of an `mmap'ed
     heap is extended.  Argument $ARG1 is a pointer to the heap, and
     $ARG2 is the new size of the heap.

 -- Probe: memory_heap_less (void *$ARG1, size_t $ARG2)
     This probe is triggered after a trailing portion of an `mmap'ed
     heap is released.  Argument $ARG1 is a pointer to the heap, and
     $ARG2 is the new size of the heap.

 -- Probe: memory_malloc_retry (size_t $ARG1)
 -- Probe: memory_realloc_retry (size_t $ARG1, void *$ARG2)
 -- Probe: memory_memalign_retry (size_t $ARG1, size_t $ARG2)
 -- Probe: memory_calloc_retry (size_t $ARG1)
     These probes are triggered when the corresponding functions fail to
     obtain the requested amount of memory from the arena in use,
     before they call `arena_get_retry' to select an alternate arena in
     which to retry the allocation.  Argument $ARG1 is the amount of
     memory requested by the user; in the `calloc' case, that is the
     total size computed from both function arguments.  In the
     `realloc' case, $ARG2 is the pointer to the memory area being
     resized.  In the `memalign' case, $ARG2 is the alignment to be
     used for the request, which may be stricter than the value passed
     to the `memalign' function.  A `memalign' probe is also used by
     functions `posix_memalign, valloc' and `pvalloc'.

     Note that the argument order does _not_ match that of the
     corresponding two-argument functions, so that in all of these
     probes the user-requested allocation size is in $ARG1.

 -- Probe: memory_arena_retry (size_t $ARG1, void *$ARG2)
     This probe is triggered within `arena_get_retry' (the function
     called to select the alternate arena in which to retry an
     allocation that failed on the first attempt), before the selection
     of an alternate arena.  This probe is redundant, but much easier
     to use when it's not important to determine which of the various
     memory allocation functions is failing to allocate on the first
     try.  Argument $ARG1 is the same as in the function-specific
     probes, except for extra room for padding introduced by functions
     that have to ensure stricter alignment.  Argument $ARG2 is the
     arena in which allocation failed.

 -- Probe: memory_arena_new (void *$ARG1, size_t $ARG2)
     This probe is triggered when `malloc' allocates and initializes an
     additional arena (not the main arena), but before the arena is
     assigned to the running thread or inserted into the internal
     linked list of arenas.  The arena's `malloc_state' internal data
     structure is located at $ARG1, within a newly-allocated heap big
     enough to hold at least $ARG2 bytes.

 -- Probe: memory_arena_reuse (void *$ARG1, void *$ARG2)
     This probe is triggered when `malloc' has just selected an existing
     arena to reuse, and (temporarily) reserved it for exclusive use.
     Argument $ARG1 is a pointer to the newly-selected arena, and $ARG2
     is a pointer to the arena previously used by that thread.

     This occurs within `reused_arena', right after the mutex mentioned
     in probe `memory_arena_reuse_wait' is acquired; argument $ARG1 will
     point to the same arena.  In this configuration, this will usually
     only occur once per thread.  The exception is when a thread first
     selected the main arena, but a subsequent allocation from it
     fails: then, and only then, may we switch to another arena to
     retry that allocation, and for further allocations within that
     thread.

 -- Probe: memory_arena_reuse_wait (void *$ARG1, void *$ARG2, void
          *$ARG3)
     This probe is triggered when `malloc' is about to wait for an arena
     to become available for reuse.  Argument $ARG1 holds a pointer to
     the mutex the thread is going to wait on, $ARG2 is a pointer to a
     newly-chosen arena to be reused, and $ARG3 is a pointer to the
     arena previously used by that thread.

     This occurs within `reused_arena', when a thread first tries to
     allocate memory or needs a retry after a failure to allocate from
     the main arena, there isn't any free arena, the maximum number of
     arenas has been reached, and an existing arena was chosen for
     reuse, but its mutex could not be immediately acquired.  The mutex
     in $ARG1 is the mutex of the selected arena.

 -- Probe: memory_arena_reuse_free_list (void *$ARG1)
     This probe is triggered when `malloc' has chosen an arena that is
     in the free list for use by a thread, within the `get_free_list'
     function.  The argument $ARG1 holds a pointer to the selected
     arena.

 -- Probe: memory_mallopt (int $ARG1, int $ARG2)
     This probe is triggered when function `mallopt' is called to change
     `malloc' internal configuration parameters, before any change to
     the parameters is made.  The arguments $ARG1 and $ARG2 are the
     ones passed to the `mallopt' function.

 -- Probe: memory_mallopt_mxfast (int $ARG1, int $ARG2)
     This probe is triggered shortly after the `memory_mallopt' probe,
     when the parameter to be changed is `M_MXFAST', and the requested
     value is in an acceptable range.  Argument $ARG1 is the requested
     value, and $ARG2 is the previous value of this `malloc' parameter.

 -- Probe: memory_mallopt_trim_threshold (int $ARG1, int $ARG2, int
          $ARG3)
     This probe is triggered shortly after the `memory_mallopt' probe,
     when the parameter to be changed is `M_TRIM_THRESHOLD'.  Argument
     $ARG1 is the requested value, $ARG2 is the previous value of this
     `malloc' parameter, and $ARG3 is nonzero if dynamic threshold
     adjustment was already disabled.

 -- Probe: memory_mallopt_top_pad (int $ARG1, int $ARG2, int $ARG3)
     This probe is triggered shortly after the `memory_mallopt' probe,
     when the parameter to be changed is `M_TOP_PAD'.  Argument $ARG1
     is the requested value, $ARG2 is the previous value of this
     `malloc' parameter, and $ARG3 is nonzero if dynamic threshold
     adjustment was already disabled.

 -- Probe: memory_mallopt_mmap_threshold (int $ARG1, int $ARG2, int
          $ARG3)
     This probe is triggered shortly after the `memory_mallopt' probe,
     when the parameter to be changed is `M_MMAP_THRESHOLD', and the
     requested value is in an acceptable range.  Argument $ARG1 is the
     requested value, $ARG2 is the previous value of this `malloc'
     parameter, and $ARG3 is nonzero if dynamic threshold adjustment
     was already disabled.

 -- Probe: memory_mallopt_mmap_max (int $ARG1, int $ARG2, int $ARG3)
     This probe is triggered shortly after the `memory_mallopt' probe,
     when the parameter to be changed is `M_MMAP_MAX'.  Argument $ARG1
     is the requested value, $ARG2 is the previous value of this
     `malloc' parameter, and $ARG3 is nonzero if dynamic threshold
     adjustment was already disabled.

 -- Probe: memory_mallopt_perturb (int $ARG1, int $ARG2)
     This probe is triggered shortly after the `memory_mallopt' probe,
     when the parameter to be changed is `M_PERTURB'.  Argument $ARG1
     is the requested value, and $ARG2 is the previous value of this
     `malloc' parameter.

 -- Probe: memory_mallopt_arena_test (int $ARG1, int $ARG2)
     This probe is triggered shortly after the `memory_mallopt' probe,
     when the parameter to be changed is `M_ARENA_TEST', and the
     requested value is in an acceptable range.  Argument $ARG1 is the
     requested value, and $ARG2 is the previous value of this `malloc'
     parameter.

 -- Probe: memory_mallopt_arena_max (int $ARG1, int $ARG2)
     This probe is triggered shortly after the `memory_mallopt' probe,
     when the parameter to be changed is `M_ARENA_MAX', and the
     requested value is in an acceptable range.  Argument $ARG1 is the
     requested value, and $ARG2 is the previous value of this `malloc'
     parameter.

 -- Probe: memory_mallopt_free_dyn_thresholds (int $ARG1, int $ARG2)
     This probe is triggered when function `free' decides to adjust the
     dynamic brk/mmap thresholds.  Argument $ARG1 and $ARG2 are the
     adjusted mmap and trim thresholds, respectively.

 -- Probe: memory_tunable_tcache_max_bytes (int $ARG1, int $ARG2)
     This probe is triggered when the `glibc.malloc.tcache_max' tunable
     is set.  Argument $ARG1 is the requested value, and $ARG2 is the
     previous value of this tunable.

36.2 Mathematical Function Probes
=================================

Some mathematical functions fall back to multiple precision arithmetic
for some inputs to get last bit precision for their return values.
This multiple precision fallback is much slower than the default
algorithms and may have a significant impact on application
performance.  The systemtap probe markers described in this section may
help you determine if your application calls mathematical functions
with inputs that may result in multiple-precision arithmetic.

   Unless explicitly mentioned otherwise, a precision of 1 implies 24
bits of precision in the mantissa of the multiple precision number.
Hence, a precision level of 32 implies 768 bits of precision in the
mantissa.

37 Tunables
***********

"Tunables" are a feature in the GNU C Library that allows application
authors and distribution maintainers to alter the runtime library
behavior to match their workload. These are implemented as a set of
switches that may be modified in different ways. The current default
method to do this is via the `GLIBC_TUNABLES' environment variable by
setting it to a string of colon-separated NAME=VALUE pairs.  For
example, the following example enables malloc checking and sets the
malloc trim threshold to 128 bytes:

     GLIBC_TUNABLES=glibc.malloc.trim_threshold=128:glibc.malloc.check=3
     export GLIBC_TUNABLES

   Tunables are not part of the GNU C Library stable ABI, and they are
subject to change or removal across releases.  Additionally, the method
to modify tunable values may change between releases and across
distributions.  It is possible to implement multiple `frontends' for
the tunables allowing distributions to choose their preferred method at
build time.

   Finally, the set of tunables available may vary between
distributions as the tunables feature allows distributions to add their
own tunables under their own namespace.

37.1 Tunable names
==================

A tunable name is split into three components, a top namespace, a
tunable namespace and the tunable name. The top namespace for tunables
implemented in the GNU C Library is `glibc'. Distributions that choose
to add custom tunables in their maintained versions of the GNU C
Library may choose to do so under their own top namespace.

   The tunable namespace is a logical grouping of tunables in a single
module. This currently holds no special significance, although that may
change in the future.

   The tunable name is the actual name of the tunable. It is possible
that different tunable namespaces may have tunables within them that
have the same name, likewise for top namespaces. Hence, we only support
identification of tunables by their full name, i.e. with the top
namespace, tunable namespace and tunable name, separated by periods.


File: libc.info,  Node: Memory Allocation Tunables,  Next: Hardware Capability Tunables,  Prev: Tunable names,  Up: Tunables

37.2 Memory Allocation Tunables
===============================

 -- Tunable namespace: glibc.malloc
     Memory allocation behavior can be modified by setting any of the
     following tunables in the `malloc' namespace:

 -- Tunable: glibc.malloc.check
     This tunable supersedes the `MALLOC_CHECK_' environment variable
     and is identical in features.

     Setting this tunable to a non-zero value enables a special (less
     efficient) memory allocator for the malloc family of functions
     that is designed to be tolerant against simple errors such as
     double calls of free with the same argument, or overruns of a
     single byte (off-by-one bugs). Not all such errors can be
     protected against, however, and memory leaks can result.  Any
     detected heap corruption results in immediate termination of the
     process.

     Like `MALLOC_CHECK_', `glibc.malloc.check' has a problem in that it
     diverges from normal program behavior by writing to `stderr',
     which could by exploited in SUID and SGID binaries.  Therefore,
     `glibc.malloc.check' is disabled by default for SUID and SGID
     binaries.  This can be enabled again by the system administrator
     by adding a file `/etc/suid-debug'; the content of the file could
     be anything or even empty.

 -- Tunable: glibc.malloc.top_pad
     This tunable supersedes the `MALLOC_TOP_PAD_' environment variable
     and is identical in features.

     This tunable determines the amount of extra memory in bytes to
     obtain from the system when any of the arenas need to be extended.
     It also specifies the number of bytes to retain when shrinking
     any of the arenas.  This provides the necessary hysteresis in heap
     size such that excessive amounts of system calls can be avoided.

     The default value of this tunable is `0'.

 -- Tunable: glibc.malloc.perturb
     This tunable supersedes the `MALLOC_PERTURB_' environment variable
     and is identical in features.

     If set to a non-zero value, memory blocks are initialized with
     values depending on some low order bits of this tunable when they
     are allocated (except when allocated by calloc) and freed.  This
     can be used to debug the use of uninitialized or freed heap
     memory. Note that this option does not guarantee that the freed
     block will have any specific values. It only guarantees that the
     content the block had before it was freed will be overwritten.

     The default value of this tunable is `0'.

 -- Tunable: glibc.malloc.mmap_threshold
     This tunable supersedes the `MALLOC_MMAP_THRESHOLD_' environment
     variable and is identical in features.

     When this tunable is set, all chunks larger than this value in
     bytes are allocated outside the normal heap, using the `mmap'
     system call. This way it is guaranteed that the memory for these
     chunks can be returned to the system on `free'. Note that requests
     smaller than this threshold might still be allocated via `mmap'.

     If this tunable is not set, the default value is set to `131072'
     bytes and the threshold is adjusted dynamically to suit the
     allocation patterns of the program.  If the tunable is set, the
     dynamic adjustment is disabled and the value is set as static.

 -- Tunable: glibc.malloc.trim_threshold
     This tunable supersedes the `MALLOC_TRIM_THRESHOLD_' environment
     variable and is identical in features.

     The value of this tunable is the minimum size (in bytes) of the
     top-most, releasable chunk in an arena that will trigger a system
     call in order to return memory to the system from that arena.

     If this tunable is not set, the default value is set as 128 KB and
     the threshold is adjusted dynamically to suit the allocation
     patterns of the program.  If the tunable is set, the dynamic
     adjustment is disabled and the value is set as static.

 -- Tunable: glibc.malloc.mmap_max
     This tunable supersedes the `MALLOC_MMAP_MAX_' environment
     variable and is identical in features.

     The value of this tunable is maximum number of chunks to allocate
     with `mmap'.  Setting this to zero disables all use of `mmap'.

     The default value of this tunable is `65536'.

 -- Tunable: glibc.malloc.arena_test
     This tunable supersedes the `MALLOC_ARENA_TEST' environment
     variable and is identical in features.

     The `glibc.malloc.arena_test' tunable specifies the number of
     arenas that can be created before the test on the limit to the
     number of arenas is conducted.  The value is ignored if
     `glibc.malloc.arena_max' is set.

     The default value of this tunable is 2 for 32-bit systems and 8
     for 64-bit systems.

 -- Tunable: glibc.malloc.arena_max
     This tunable supersedes the `MALLOC_ARENA_MAX' environment
     variable and is identical in features.

     This tunable sets the number of arenas to use in a process
     regardless of the number of cores in the system.

     The default value of this tunable is `0', meaning that the limit
     on the number of arenas is determined by the number of CPU cores
     online.  For 32-bit systems the limit is twice the number of cores
     online and on 64-bit systems, it is 8 times the number of cores
     online.

 -- Tunable: glibc.malloc.tcache_max
     The maximum size of a request (in bytes) which may be met via the
     per-thread cache.  The default (and maximum) value is 1032 bytes on
     64-bit systems and 516 bytes on 32-bit systems.

 -- Tunable: glibc.malloc.tcache_count
     The maximum number of chunks of each size to cache. The default is
     7.  There is no upper limit, other than available system memory.
     If set to zero, the per-thread cache is effectively disabled.

     The approximate maximum overhead of the per-thread cache is thus
     equal to the number of bins times the chunk count in each bin
     times the size of each chunk.  With defaults, the approximate
     maximum overhead of the per-thread cache is approximately 236 KB
     on 64-bit systems and 118 KB on 32-bit systems.

 -- Tunable: glibc.malloc.tcache_unsorted_limit
     When the user requests memory and the request cannot be met via the
     per-thread cache, the arenas are used to meet the request.  At this
     time, additional chunks will be moved from existing arena lists to
     pre-fill the corresponding cache.  While copies from the fastbins,
     smallbins, and regular bins are bounded and predictable due to the
     bin sizes, copies from the unsorted bin are not bounded, and incur
     additional time penalties as they need to be sorted as they're
     scanned.  To make scanning the unsorted list more predictable and
     bounded, the user may set this tunable to limit the number of
     chunks that are scanned from the unsorted list while searching for
     chunks to pre-fill the per-thread cache with.  The default, or
     when set to zero, is no limit.

37.3 Hardware Capability Tunables
=================================

 -- Tunable namespace: glibc.tune
     Behavior of the GNU C Library can be tuned to assume specific
     hardware capabilities by setting the following tunables in the
     `tune' namespace:

 -- Tunable: glibc.tune.hwcap_mask
     This tunable supersedes the `LD_HWCAP_MASK' environment variable
     and is identical in features.

     The `AT_HWCAP' key in the Auxilliary Vector specifies instruction
     set extensions available in the processor at runtime for some
     architectures.  The `glibc.tune.hwcap_mask' tunable allows the
     user to mask out those capabilities at runtime, thus disabling use
     of those extensions.

 -- Tunable: glibc.tune.hwcaps
     The `glibc.tune.hwcaps=-xxx,yyy,-zzz...' tunable allows the user to
     enable CPU/ARCH feature `yyy', disable CPU/ARCH feature `xxx' and
     `zzz' where the feature name is case-sensitive and has to match
     the ones in `sysdeps/x86/cpu-features.h'.

     This tunable is specific to i386 and x86-64.

 -- Tunable: glibc.tune.cpu
     The `glibc.tune.cpu=xxx' tunable allows the user to tell the GNU C
     Library to assume that the CPU is `xxx' where xxx may have one of
     these values: `generic', `falkor', `thunderxt88'.

     This tunable is specific to aarch64.

 -- Tunable: glibc.tune.x86_data_cache_size
     The `glibc.tune.x86_data_cache_size' tunable allows the user to set
     data cache size in bytes for use in memory and string routines.

     This tunable is specific to i386 and x86-64.

 -- Tunable: glibc.tune.x86_shared_cache_size
     The `glibc.tune.x86_shared_cache_size' tunable allows the user to
     set shared cache size in bytes for use in memory and string
     routines.

 -- Tunable: glibc.tune.x86_non_temporal_threshold
     The `glibc.tune.x86_non_temporal_threshold' tunable allows the user
     to set threshold in bytes for non temporal store.

     This tunable is specific to i386 and x86-64.

features has been written, we are publishing it here.

File: libc.info,  Node: Consistency Checking,  Next: Variadic Functions,  Up: Language Features

A.1 Explicitly Checking Internal Consistency
============================================

When you're writing a program, it's often a good idea to put in checks
at strategic places for "impossible" errors or violations of basic
assumptions.  These kinds of checks are helpful in debugging problems
with the interfaces between different parts of the program, for example.

   The `assert' macro, defined in the header file `assert.h', provides
a convenient way to abort the program while printing a message about
where in the program the error was detected.

   Once you think your program is debugged, you can disable the error
checks performed by the `assert' macro by recompiling with the macro
`NDEBUG' defined.  This means you don't actually have to change the
program source code to disable these checks.

   But disabling these consistency checks is undesirable unless they
make the program significantly slower.  All else being equal, more error
checking is good no matter who is running the program.  A wise user
would rather have a program crash, visibly, than have it return nonsense
without indicating anything might be wrong.

 -- Macro: void assert (int EXPRESSION)
     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Unsafe heap corrupt | AC-Unsafe mem
     lock corrupt | *Note POSIX Safety Concepts::.

     Verify the programmer's belief that EXPRESSION is nonzero at this
     point in the program.

     If `NDEBUG' is not defined, `assert' tests the value of
     EXPRESSION.  If it is false (zero), `assert' aborts the program
     (*note Aborting a Program::) after printing a message of the form:

          `FILE':LINENUM: FUNCTION: Assertion `EXPRESSION' failed.

     on the standard error stream `stderr' (*note Standard Streams::).
     The filename and line number are taken from the C preprocessor
     macros `__FILE__' and `__LINE__' and specify where the call to
     `assert' was made.  When using the GNU C compiler, the name of the
     function which calls `assert' is taken from the built-in variable
     `__PRETTY_FUNCTION__'; with older compilers, the function name and
     following colon are omitted.

     If the preprocessor macro `NDEBUG' is defined before `assert.h' is
     included, the `assert' macro is defined to do absolutely nothing.

     *Warning:* Even the argument expression EXPRESSION is not
     evaluated if `NDEBUG' is in effect.  So never use `assert' with
     arguments that involve side effects.  For example, `assert (++i >
     0);' is a bad idea, because `i' will not be incremented if
     `NDEBUG' is defined.

   Sometimes the "impossible" condition you want to check for is an
error return from an operating system function.  Then it is useful to
display not only where the program crashes, but also what error was
returned.  The `assert_perror' macro makes this easy.

 -- Macro: void assert_perror (int ERRNUM)
     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Unsafe heap corrupt | AC-Unsafe mem
     lock corrupt | *Note POSIX Safety Concepts::.

     Similar to `assert', but verifies that ERRNUM is zero.

     If `NDEBUG' is not defined, `assert_perror' tests the value of
     ERRNUM.  If it is nonzero, `assert_perror' aborts the program
     after printing a message of the form:

          `FILE':LINENUM: FUNCTION: ERROR TEXT

     on the standard error stream.  The file name, line number, and
     function name are as for `assert'.  The error text is the result of
     `strerror (ERRNUM)'.  *Note Error Messages::.

     Like `assert', if `NDEBUG' is defined before `assert.h' is
     included, the `assert_perror' macro does absolutely nothing.  It
     does not evaluate the argument, so ERRNUM should not have any side
     effects.  It is best for ERRNUM to be just a simple variable
     reference; often it will be `errno'.

     This macro is a GNU extension.

   *Usage note:* The `assert' facility is designed for detecting
_internal inconsistency_; it is not suitable for reporting invalid
input or improper usage by the _user_ of the program.

   The information in the diagnostic messages printed by the `assert'
and `assert_perror' macro is intended to help you, the programmer,
track down the cause of a bug, but is not really useful for telling a
user of your program why his or her input was invalid or why a command
could not be carried out.  What's more, your program should not abort
when given invalid input, as `assert' would do--it should exit with
nonzero status (*note Exit Status::) after printing its error messages,
or perhaps read another command or move on to the next input file.

   *Note Error Messages::, for information on printing error messages
for problems that _do not_ represent bugs in the program.

A.2 Variadic Functions
======================

ISO C defines a syntax for declaring a function to take a variable
number or type of arguments.  (Such functions are referred to as
"varargs functions" or "variadic functions".)  However, the language
itself provides no mechanism for such functions to access their
non-required arguments; instead, you use the variable arguments macros
defined in `stdarg.h'.

   This section describes how to declare variadic functions, how to
write them, and how to call them properly.

A.2.1 Why Variadic Functions are Used
-------------------------------------

Ordinary C functions take a fixed number of arguments.  When you define
a function, you specify the data type for each argument.  Every call to
the function should supply the expected number of arguments, with types
that can be converted to the specified ones.  Thus, if the function
`foo' is declared with `int foo (int, char *);' then you must call it
with two arguments, a number (any kind will do) and a string pointer.

   But some functions perform operations that can meaningfully accept an
unlimited number of arguments.

   In some cases a function can handle any number of values by
operating on all of them as a block.  For example, consider a function
that allocates a one-dimensional array with `malloc' to hold a
specified set of values.  This operation makes sense for any number of
values, as long as the length of the array corresponds to that number.
Without facilities for variable arguments, you would have to define a
separate function for each possible array size.

   The library function `printf' (*note Formatted Output::) is an
example of another class of function where variable arguments are
useful.  This function prints its arguments (which can vary in type as
well as number) under the control of a format template string.

   These are good reasons to define a "variadic" function which can
handle as many arguments as the caller chooses to pass.

   Some functions such as `open' take a fixed set of arguments, but
occasionally ignore the last few.  Strict adherence to ISO C requires
these functions to be defined as variadic; in practice, however, the GNU
C compiler and most other C compilers let you define such a function to
take a fixed set of arguments--the most it can ever use--and then only
_declare_ the function as variadic (or not declare its arguments at
all!).

A.2.2 How Variadic Functions are Defined and Used
-------------------------------------------------

Defining and using a variadic function involves three steps:

     the argument list, and using special macros to access the variable
     arguments.  *Note Receiving Arguments::.

   * _Declare_ the function as variadic, using a prototype with an
     ellipsis (`...'), in all the files which call it.  *Note Variadic
     Prototypes::.

   * _Call_ the function by writing the fixed arguments followed by the
     additional variable arguments.  *Note Calling Variadics::.

A.2.2.1 Syntax for Variable Arguments
.....................................

A function that accepts a variable number of arguments must be declared
with a prototype that says so.   You write the fixed arguments as usual,
and then tack on `...' to indicate the possibility of additional
arguments.  The syntax of ISO C requires at least one fixed argument
before the `...'.  For example,

     int
     func (const char *a, int b, ...)
     {
       ...
     }

defines a function `func' which returns an `int' and takes two required
arguments, a `const char *' and an `int'.  These are followed by any
number of anonymous arguments.

   *Portability note:* For some C compilers, the last required argument
must not be declared `register' in the function definition.
Furthermore, this argument's type must be "self-promoting": that is,
the default promotions must not change its type.  This rules out array
and function types, as well as `float', `char' (whether signed or not)
and `short int' (whether signed or not).  This is actually an ISO C
requirement.

A.2.2.2 Receiving the Argument Values
.....................................

Ordinary fixed arguments have individual names, and you can use these
names to access their values.  But optional arguments have no
names--nothing but `...'.  How can you access them?

   The only way to access them is sequentially, in the order they were
written, and you must use special macros from `stdarg.h' in the
following three step process:

  1. You initialize an argument pointer variable of type `va_list' using
     `va_start'.  The argument pointer when initialized points to the
     first optional argument.

  2. You access the optional arguments by successive calls to `va_arg'.
     The first call to `va_arg' gives you the first optional argument,
     the next call gives you the second, and so on.

     You can stop at any time if you wish to ignore any remaining
     optional arguments.  It is perfectly all right for a function to
     access fewer arguments than were supplied in the call, but you
     will get garbage values if you try to access too many arguments.

  3. You indicate that you are finished with the argument pointer
     variable by calling `va_end'.

     (In practice, with most C compilers, calling `va_end' does nothing.
     This is always true in the GNU C compiler.  But you might as well
     call `va_end' just in case your program is someday compiled with a
     peculiar compiler.)

   *Note Argument Macros::, for the full definitions of `va_start',
`va_arg' and `va_end'.

   Steps 1 and 3 must be performed in the function that accepts the
optional arguments.  However, you can pass the `va_list' variable as an
argument to another function and perform all or part of step 2 there.

   You can perform the entire sequence of three steps multiple times
within a single function invocation.  If you want to ignore the optional
arguments, you can do these steps zero times.

   You can have more than one argument pointer variable if you like.
You can initialize each variable with `va_start' when you wish, and
then you can fetch arguments with each argument pointer as you wish.
Each argument pointer variable will sequence through the same set of
argument values, but at its own pace.

   *Portability note:* With some compilers, once you pass an argument
pointer value to a subroutine, you must not keep using the same
argument pointer value after that subroutine returns.  For full
portability, you should just pass it to `va_end'.  This is actually an
ISO C requirement, but most ANSI C compilers work happily regardless.

A.2.2.3 How Many Arguments Were Supplied
........................................

There is no general way for a function to determine the number and type
of the optional arguments it was called with.  So whoever designs the
function typically designs a convention for the caller to specify the
number and type of arguments.  It is up to you to define an appropriate
calling convention for each variadic function, and write all calls
accordingly.

   One kind of calling convention is to pass the number of optional
arguments as one of the fixed arguments.  This convention works provided
all of the optional arguments are of the same type.

   A similar alternative is to have one of the required arguments be a
bit mask, with a bit for each possible purpose for which an optional
argument might be supplied.  You would test the bits in a predefined
sequence; if the bit is set, fetch the value of the next argument,
otherwise use a default value.

   A required argument can be used as a pattern to specify both the
number and types of the optional arguments.  The format string argument
to `printf' is one example of this (*note Formatted Output Functions::).

   Another possibility is to pass an "end marker" value as the last
optional argument.  For example, for a function that manipulates an
arbitrary number of pointer arguments, a null pointer might indicate the
end of the argument list.  (This assumes that a null pointer isn't
otherwise meaningful to the function.)  The `execl' function works in
just this way; see *Note Executing a File::.

A.2.2.4 Calling Variadic Functions
..................................

You don't have to do anything special to call a variadic function.
Just put the arguments (required arguments, followed by optional ones)
inside parentheses, separated by commas, as usual.  But you must declare
the function with a prototype and know how the argument values are
converted.

   In principle, functions that are _defined_ to be variadic must also
be _declared_ to be variadic using a function prototype whenever you
call them.  (*Note Variadic Prototypes::, for how.)  This is because
some C compilers use a different calling convention to pass the same set
of argument values to a function depending on whether that function
takes variable arguments or fixed arguments.

   In practice, the GNU C compiler always passes a given set of argument
types in the same way regardless of whether they are optional or
required.  So, as long as the argument types are self-promoting, you can
safely omit declaring them.  Usually it is a good idea to declare the
argument types for variadic functions, and indeed for all functions.
But there are a few functions which it is extremely convenient not to
have to declare as variadic--for example, `open' and `printf'.

   Since the prototype doesn't specify types for optional arguments, in
a call to a variadic function the "default argument promotions" are
performed on the optional argument values.  This means the objects of
type `char' or `short int' (whether signed or not) are promoted to
either `int' or `unsigned int', as appropriate; and that objects of
type `float' are promoted to type `double'.  So, if the caller passes a
`char' as an optional argument, it is promoted to an `int', and the
function can access it with `va_arg (AP, int)'.

   Conversion of the required arguments is controlled by the function
prototype in the usual way: the argument expression is converted to the
declared argument type as if it were being assigned to a variable of
that type.


File: libc.info,  Node: Argument Macros,  Prev: Calling Variadics,  Up: How Variadic

A.2.2.5 Argument Access Macros
..............................

Here are descriptions of the macros used to retrieve variable arguments.
These macros are defined in the header file `stdarg.h'.  

 -- Data Type: va_list
     The type `va_list' is used for argument pointer variables.

 -- Macro: void va_start (va_list AP, LAST-REQUIRED)
     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Safe | AC-Safe | *Note POSIX Safety
     Concepts::.

     This macro initializes the argument pointer variable AP to point
     to the first of the optional arguments of the current function;
     LAST-REQUIRED must be the last required argument to the function.

 -- Macro: TYPE va_arg (va_list AP, TYPE)
     Preliminary: | MT-Safe race:ap | AS-Safe | AC-Unsafe corrupt |
     *Note POSIX Safety Concepts::.

     The `va_arg' macro returns the value of the next optional argument,
     and modifies the value of AP to point to the subsequent argument.
     Thus, successive uses of `va_arg' return successive optional
     arguments.

     The type of the value returned by `va_arg' is TYPE as specified in
     the call.  TYPE must be a self-promoting type (not `char' or
     `short int' or `float') that matches the type of the actual
     argument.

 -- Macro: void va_end (va_list AP)
     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Safe | AC-Safe | *Note POSIX Safety
     Concepts::.

     This ends the use of AP.  After a `va_end' call, further `va_arg'
     calls with the same AP may not work.  You should invoke `va_end'
     before returning from the function in which `va_start' was invoked
     with the same AP argument.

     In the GNU C Library, `va_end' does nothing, and you need not ever
     use it except for reasons of portability.


   Sometimes it is necessary to parse the list of parameters more than
once or one wants to remember a certain position in the parameter list.
To do this, one will have to make a copy of the current value of the
argument.  But `va_list' is an opaque type and one cannot necessarily
assign the value of one variable of type `va_list' to another variable
of the same type.

 -- Macro: void va_copy (va_list DEST, va_list SRC)
 -- Macro: void __va_copy (va_list DEST, va_list SRC)
     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Safe | AC-Safe | *Note POSIX Safety
     Concepts::.

     The `va_copy' macro allows copying of objects of type `va_list'
     even if this is not an integral type.  The argument pointer in
     DEST is initialized to point to the same argument as the pointer
     in SRC.

     This macro was added in ISO C99.  When building for strict
     conformance to ISO C90 (`gcc -ansi'), it is not available.  The
     macro `__va_copy' is available as a GNU extension in any standards
     mode; before GCC 3.0, it was the only macro for this functionality.

   If you want to use `va_copy' and be portable to pre-C99 systems, you
should always be prepared for the possibility that this macro will not
be available.  On architectures where a simple assignment is invalid,
hopefully `va_copy' _will_ be available, so one should always write
something like this if concerned about pre-C99 portability:

     {
       va_list ap, save;
       ...
     #ifdef va_copy
       va_copy (save, ap);
     #else
       save = ap;
     #endif
       ...
     }

A.2.3 Example of a Variadic Function
------------------------------------

Here is a complete sample function that accepts a variable number of
arguments.  The first argument to the function is the count of remaining
arguments, which are added up and the result returned.  While trivial,
this function is sufficient to illustrate how to use the variable
arguments facility.


     #include <stdarg.h>
     #include <stdio.h>

     int
     add_em_up (int count,...)
     {
       va_list ap;
       int i, sum;

       va_start (ap, count);         /* Initialize the argument list. */

       sum = 0;
       for (i = 0; i < count; i++)
         sum += va_arg (ap, int);    /* Get the next argument value. */

       va_end (ap);                  /* Clean up. */
       return sum;
     }

     int
     main (void)
     {
       /* This call prints 16. */
       printf ("%d\n", add_em_up (3, 5, 5, 6));

       /* This call prints 55. */
       printf ("%d\n", add_em_up (10, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10));

       return 0;
     }

A.3 Null Pointer Constant
=========================

The null pointer constant is guaranteed not to point to any real object.
You can assign it to any pointer variable since it has type `void *'.
The preferred way to write a null pointer constant is with `NULL'.

 -- Macro: void * NULL
     This is a null pointer constant.

   You can also use `0' or `(void *)0' as a null pointer constant, but
using `NULL' is cleaner because it makes the purpose of the constant
more evident.

   If you use the null pointer constant as a function argument, then for
complete portability you should make sure that the function has a
prototype declaration.  Otherwise, if the target machine has two
different pointer representations, the compiler won't know which
representation to use for that argument.  You can avoid the problem by
explicitly casting the constant to the proper pointer type, but we
recommend instead adding a prototype for the function you are calling.


File: libc.info,  Node: Important Data Types,  Next: Data Type Measurements,  Prev: Null Pointer Constant,  Up: Language Features

A.4 Important Data Types
========================

The result of subtracting two pointers in C is always an integer, but
the precise data type varies from C compiler to C compiler.  Likewise,
the data type of the result of `sizeof' also varies between compilers.
ISO C defines standard aliases for these two types, so you can refer to
them in a portable fashion.  They are defined in the header file
`stddef.h'.  

 -- Data Type: ptrdiff_t
     This is the signed integer type of the result of subtracting two
     pointers.  For example, with the declaration `char *p1, *p2;', the
     expression `p2 - p1' is of type `ptrdiff_t'.  This will probably
     be one of the standard signed integer types (`short int', `int' or
     `long int'), but might be a nonstandard type that exists only for
     this purpose.

 -- Data Type: size_t
     This is an unsigned integer type used to represent the sizes of
     objects.  The result of the `sizeof' operator is of this type, and
     functions such as `malloc' (*note Unconstrained Allocation::) and
     `memcpy' (*note Copying Strings and Arrays::) accept arguments of
     this type to specify object sizes.  On systems using the GNU C
     Library, this will be `unsigned int' or `unsigned long int'.

     *Usage Note:* `size_t' is the preferred way to declare any
     arguments or variables that hold the size of an object.

   *Compatibility Note:* Implementations of C before the advent of
ISO C generally used `unsigned int' for representing object sizes and
`int' for pointer subtraction results.  They did not necessarily define
either `size_t' or `ptrdiff_t'.  Unix systems did define `size_t', in
`sys/types.h', but the definition was usually a signed type.

A.5 Data Type Measurements
==========================

Most of the time, if you choose the proper C data type for each object
in your program, you need not be concerned with just how it is
represented or how many bits it uses.  When you do need such
information, the C language itself does not provide a way to get it.
The header files `limits.h' and `float.h' contain macros which give you
this information in full detail.

* Menu:

* Width of Type::           How many bits does an integer type hold?
* Range of Type::           What are the largest and smallest values
			     that an integer type can hold?
* Floating Type Macros::    Parameters that measure the floating point types.
* Structure Measurement::   Getting measurements on structure types.


File: libc.info,  Node: Width of Type,  Next: Range of Type,  Up: Data Type Measurements

A.5.1 Computing the Width of an Integer Data Type
-------------------------------------------------

The most common reason that a program needs to know how many bits are in
an integer type is for using an array of `long int' as a bit vector.
You can access the bit at index N with

     vector[N / LONGBITS] & (1 << (N % LONGBITS))

provided you define `LONGBITS' as the number of bits in a `long int'.

   There is no operator in the C language that can give you the number
of bits in an integer data type.  But you can compute it from the macro
`CHAR_BIT', defined in the header file `limits.h'.

 -- Macro: int CHAR_BIT
     This is the number of bits in a `char'.  POSIX.1-2001 requires
     this to be 8.

     You can compute the number of bits in any data type TYPE like this:

          sizeof (TYPE) * CHAR_BIT

   That expression includes padding bits as well as value and sign bits.
On all systems supported by the GNU C Library, standard integer types
other than `_Bool' do not have any padding bits.  TS 18661-1:2014
defines additional macros for the width of integer types (the number of
value and sign bits); these macros can also be used in `#if'
preprocessor directives, whereas `sizeof' cannot.  The following macros
are defined in `limits.h'.

`CHAR_WIDTH'
`SCHAR_WIDTH'
`UCHAR_WIDTH'
`SHRT_WIDTH'
`USHRT_WIDTH'
`INT_WIDTH'
`UINT_WIDTH'
`LONG_WIDTH'
`ULONG_WIDTH'
`LLONG_WIDTH'
`ULLONG_WIDTH'
     These are the widths of the types `char', `signed char', `unsigned
     char', `short int', `unsigned short int', `int', `unsigned int',
     `long int', `unsigned long int', `long long int' and `unsigned
     long long int', respectively.

   Further such macros are defined in `stdint.h'.  Apart from those for
types specified by width (*note Integers::), the following are defined.

`INTPTR_WIDTH'
`UINTPTR_WIDTH'
`PTRDIFF_WIDTH'
`SIG_ATOMIC_WIDTH'
`SIZE_WIDTH'
`WCHAR_WIDTH'
`WINT_WIDTH'
     These are the widths of the types `intptr_t', `uintptr_t',
     `ptrdiff_t', `sig_atomic_t', `size_t', `wchar_t' and `wint_t',
     respectively.

A.5.2 Range of an Integer Type
------------------------------

Suppose you need to store an integer value which can range from zero to
one million.  Which is the smallest type you can use?  There is no
general rule; it depends on the C compiler and target machine.  You can
use the `MIN' and `MAX' macros in `limits.h' to determine which type
will work.

   Each signed integer type has a pair of macros which give the smallest
and largest values that it can hold.  Each unsigned integer type has one
such macro, for the maximum value; the minimum value is, of course,
zero.

   The values of these macros are all integer constant expressions.  The
`MAX' and `MIN' macros for `char' and `short int' types have values of
type `int'.  The `MAX' and `MIN' macros for the other types have values
of the same type described by the macro--thus, `ULONG_MAX' has type
`unsigned long int'.

`SCHAR_MIN'
     This is the minimum value that can be represented by a
     `signed char'.

`SCHAR_MAX'
`UCHAR_MAX'
     These are the maximum values that can be represented by a
     `signed char' and `unsigned char', respectively.

`CHAR_MIN'
     This is the minimum value that can be represented by a `char'.
     It's equal to `SCHAR_MIN' if `char' is signed, or zero otherwise.

`CHAR_MAX'
     This is the maximum value that can be represented by a `char'.
     It's equal to `SCHAR_MAX' if `char' is signed, or `UCHAR_MAX'
     otherwise.

`SHRT_MIN'
     This is the minimum value that can be represented by a
     `signed short int'.  On most machines that the GNU C Library runs
     on, `short' integers are 16-bit quantities.

`SHRT_MAX'
`USHRT_MAX'
     These are the maximum values that can be represented by a
     `signed short int' and `unsigned short int', respectively.

`INT_MIN'
     This is the minimum value that can be represented by a
     `signed int'.  On most machines that the GNU C Library runs on, an
     `int' is a 32-bit quantity.

`INT_MAX'
`UINT_MAX'
     These are the maximum values that can be represented by,
     respectively, the type `signed int' and the type `unsigned int'.

`LONG_MIN'
     This is the minimum value that can be represented by a
     `signed long int'.  On most machines that the GNU C Library runs
     on, `long' integers are 32-bit quantities, the same size as `int'.

`LONG_MAX'
`ULONG_MAX'
     These are the maximum values that can be represented by a
     `signed long int' and `unsigned long int', respectively.

`LLONG_MIN'
     This is the minimum value that can be represented by a
     `signed long long int'.  On most machines that the GNU C Library
     runs on, `long long' integers are 64-bit quantities.

`LLONG_MAX'
`ULLONG_MAX'
     These are the maximum values that can be represented by a `signed
     long long int' and `unsigned long long int', respectively.

`LONG_LONG_MIN'
`LONG_LONG_MAX'
`ULONG_LONG_MAX'
     These are obsolete names for `LLONG_MIN', `LLONG_MAX', and
     `ULLONG_MAX'.  They are only available if `_GNU_SOURCE' is defined
     (*note Feature Test Macros::).  In GCC versions prior to 3.0,
     these were the only names available.

`WCHAR_MAX'
     This is the maximum value that can be represented by a `wchar_t'.
     *Note Extended Char Intro::.

   The header file `limits.h' also defines some additional constants
that parameterize various operating system and file system limits.
These constants are described in *Note System Configuration::.

A.5.3 Floating Type Macros
--------------------------

The specific representation of floating point numbers varies from
machine to machine.  Because floating point numbers are represented
internally as approximate quantities, algorithms for manipulating
floating point data often need to take account of the precise details of
the machine's floating point representation.

   Some of the functions in the C library itself need this information;
for example, the algorithms for printing and reading floating point
numbers (*note I/O on Streams::) and for calculating trigonometric and
irrational functions (*note Mathematics::) use it to avoid round-off
error and loss of accuracy.  User programs that implement numerical
analysis techniques also often need this information in order to
minimize or compute error bounds.

   The header file `float.h' describes the format used by your machine.

A.5.3.1 Floating Point Representation Concepts
..............................................

This section introduces the terminology for describing floating point
representations.

   You are probably already familiar with most of these concepts in
terms of scientific or exponential notation for floating point numbers.
For example, the number `123456.0' could be expressed in exponential
notation as `1.23456e+05', a shorthand notation indicating that the
mantissa `1.23456' is multiplied by the base `10' raised to power `5'.

   More formally, the internal representation of a floating point number
can be characterized in terms of the following parameters:

   * The "sign" is either `-1' or `1'.

   * The "base" or "radix" for exponentiation, an integer greater than
     `1'.  This is a constant for a particular representation.

   * The "exponent" to which the base is raised.  The upper and lower
     bounds of the exponent value are constants for a particular
     representation.

     Sometimes, in the actual bits representing the floating point
     number, the exponent is "biased" by adding a constant to it, to
     make it always be represented as an unsigned quantity.  This is
     only important if you have some reason to pick apart the bit
     fields making up the floating point number by hand, which is
     something for which the GNU C Library provides no support.  So
     this is ignored in the discussion that follows.

   * The "mantissa" or "significand" is an unsigned integer which is a
     part of each floating point number.

   * The "precision" of the mantissa.  If the base of the representation
     is B, then the precision is the number of base-B digits in the
     mantissa.  This is a constant for a particular representation.

     Many floating point representations have an implicit "hidden bit"
     in the mantissa.  This is a bit which is present virtually in the
     mantissa, but not stored in memory because its value is always 1
     in a normalized number.  The precision figure (see above) includes
     any hidden bits.

     Again, the GNU C Library provides no facilities for dealing with
     such low-level aspects of the representation.

   The mantissa of a floating point number represents an implicit
fraction whose denominator is the base raised to the power of the
precision.  Since the largest representable mantissa is one less than
this denominator, the value of the fraction is always strictly less
than `1'.  The mathematical value of a floating point number is then
the product of this fraction, the sign, and the base raised to the
exponent.

   We say that the floating point number is "normalized" if the
fraction is at least `1/B', where B is the base.  In other words, the
mantissa would be too large to fit if it were multiplied by the base.
Non-normalized numbers are sometimes called "denormal"; they contain
less precision than the representation normally can hold.

   If the number is not normalized, then you can subtract `1' from the
exponent while multiplying the mantissa by the base, and get another
floating point number with the same value.  "Normalization" consists of
doing this repeatedly until the number is normalized.  Two distinct
normalized floating point numbers cannot be equal in value.

   (There is an exception to this rule: if the mantissa is zero, it is
considered normalized.  Another exception happens on certain machines
where the exponent is as small as the representation can hold.  Then it
is impossible to subtract `1' from the exponent, so a number may be
normalized even if its fraction is less than `1/B'.)

A.5.3.2 Floating Point Parameters
.................................

These macro definitions can be accessed by including the header file
`float.h' in your program.

   Macro names starting with `FLT_' refer to the `float' type, while
names beginning with `DBL_' refer to the `double' type and names
beginning with `LDBL_' refer to the `long double' type.  (If GCC does
not support `long double' as a distinct data type on a target machine
then the values for the `LDBL_' constants are equal to the
corresponding constants for the `double' type.)

   Of these macros, only `FLT_RADIX' is guaranteed to be a constant
expression.  The other macros listed here cannot be reliably used in
places that require constant expressions, such as `#if' preprocessing
directives or in the dimensions of static arrays.

   Although the ISO C standard specifies minimum and maximum values for
most of these parameters, the GNU C implementation uses whatever values
describe the floating point representation of the target machine.  So in
principle GNU C actually satisfies the ISO C requirements only if the
target machine is suitable.  In practice, all the machines currently
supported are suitable.

`FLT_ROUNDS'
     This value characterizes the rounding mode for floating point
     addition.  The following values indicate standard rounding modes:

    `-1'
          The mode is indeterminable.

    `0'
          Rounding is towards zero.

    `1'
          Rounding is to the nearest number.

    `2'
          Rounding is towards positive infinity.

    `3'
          Rounding is towards negative infinity.

     Any other value represents a machine-dependent nonstandard rounding
     mode.

     On most machines, the value is `1', in accordance with the IEEE
     standard for floating point.

     Here is a table showing how certain values round for each possible
     value of `FLT_ROUNDS', if the other aspects of the representation
     match the IEEE single-precision standard.

                          0      1             2             3
           1.00000003    1.0    1.0           1.00000012    1.0
           1.00000007    1.0    1.00000012    1.00000012    1.0
          -1.00000003   -1.0   -1.0          -1.0          -1.00000012
          -1.00000007   -1.0   -1.00000012   -1.0          -1.00000012

`FLT_RADIX'
     This is the value of the base, or radix, of the exponent
     representation.  This is guaranteed to be a constant expression,
     unlike the other macros described in this section.  The value is 2
     on all machines we know of except the IBM 360 and derivatives.

`FLT_MANT_DIG'
     This is the number of base-`FLT_RADIX' digits in the floating point
     mantissa for the `float' data type.  The following expression
     yields `1.0' (even though mathematically it should not) due to the
     limited number of mantissa digits:

          float radix = FLT_RADIX;

          1.0f + 1.0f / radix / radix / ... / radix

     where `radix' appears `FLT_MANT_DIG' times.

`DBL_MANT_DIG'
`LDBL_MANT_DIG'
     This is the number of base-`FLT_RADIX' digits in the floating point
     mantissa for the data types `double' and `long double',
     respectively.

`FLT_DIG'
     This is the number of decimal digits of precision for the `float'
     data type.  Technically, if P and B are the precision and base
     (respectively) for the representation, then the decimal precision
     Q is the maximum number of decimal digits such that any floating
     point number with Q base 10 digits can be rounded to a floating
     point number with P base B digits and back again, without change
     to the Q decimal digits.

     The value of this macro is supposed to be at least `6', to satisfy
     ISO C.

`DBL_DIG'
`LDBL_DIG'
     These are similar to `FLT_DIG', but for the data types `double'
     and `long double', respectively.  The values of these macros are
     supposed to be at least `10'.

`FLT_MIN_EXP'
     This is the smallest possible exponent value for type `float'.
     More precisely, it is the minimum negative integer such that the
     value `FLT_RADIX' raised to this power minus 1 can be represented
     as a normalized floating point number of type `float'.

`DBL_MIN_EXP'
`LDBL_MIN_EXP'
     These are similar to `FLT_MIN_EXP', but for the data types
     `double' and `long double', respectively.

`FLT_MIN_10_EXP'
     This is the minimum negative integer such that `10' raised to this
     power minus 1 can be represented as a normalized floating point
     number of type `float'.  This is supposed to be `-37' or even less.

`DBL_MIN_10_EXP'
`LDBL_MIN_10_EXP'
     These are similar to `FLT_MIN_10_EXP', but for the data types
     `double' and `long double', respectively.

`FLT_MAX_EXP'
     This is the largest possible exponent value for type `float'.  More
     precisely, this is the maximum positive integer such that value
     `FLT_RADIX' raised to this power minus 1 can be represented as a
     floating point number of type `float'.

`DBL_MAX_EXP'
`LDBL_MAX_EXP'
     These are similar to `FLT_MAX_EXP', but for the data types
     `double' and `long double', respectively.

`FLT_MAX_10_EXP'
     This is the maximum positive integer such that `10' raised to this
     power minus 1 can be represented as a normalized floating point
     number of type `float'.  This is supposed to be at least `37'.

`DBL_MAX_10_EXP'
`LDBL_MAX_10_EXP'
     These are similar to `FLT_MAX_10_EXP', but for the data types
     `double' and `long double', respectively.

`FLT_MAX'
     The value of this macro is the maximum number representable in type
     `float'.  It is supposed to be at least `1E+37'.  The value has
     type `float'.

     The smallest representable number is `- FLT_MAX'.

`DBL_MAX'
`LDBL_MAX'
     These are similar to `FLT_MAX', but for the data types `double'
     and `long double', respectively.  The type of the macro's value is
     the same as the type it describes.

`FLT_MIN'
     The value of this macro is the minimum normalized positive floating
     point number that is representable in type `float'.  It is supposed
     to be no more than `1E-37'.

`DBL_MIN'
`LDBL_MIN'
     These are similar to `FLT_MIN', but for the data types `double'
     and `long double', respectively.  The type of the macro's value is
     the same as the type it describes.

`FLT_EPSILON'
     This is the difference between 1 and the smallest floating point
     number of type `float' that is greater than 1.  It's supposed to
     be no greater than `1E-5'.

`DBL_EPSILON'
`LDBL_EPSILON'
     These are similar to `FLT_EPSILON', but for the data types
     `double' and `long double', respectively.  The type of the macro's
     value is the same as the type it describes.  The values are not
     supposed to be greater than `1E-9'.

A.5.3.3 IEEE Floating Point
...........................

Here is an example showing how the floating type measurements come out
for the most common floating point representation, specified by the
`IEEE Standard for Binary Floating Point Arithmetic (ANSI/IEEE Std
754-1985)'.  Nearly all computers designed since the 1980s use this
format.

   The IEEE single-precision float representation uses a base of 2.
There is a sign bit, a mantissa with 23 bits plus one hidden bit (so
the total precision is 24 base-2 digits), and an 8-bit exponent that
can represent values in the range -125 to 128, inclusive.

   So, for an implementation that uses this representation for the
`float' data type, appropriate values for the corresponding parameters
are:

     FLT_RADIX                             2
     FLT_MANT_DIG                         24
     FLT_DIG                               6
     FLT_MIN_EXP                        -125
     FLT_MIN_10_EXP                      -37
     FLT_MAX_EXP                         128
     FLT_MAX_10_EXP                      +38
     FLT_MIN                 1.17549435E-38F
     FLT_MAX                 3.40282347E+38F
     FLT_EPSILON             1.19209290E-07F

   Here are the values for the `double' data type:

     DBL_MANT_DIG                         53
     DBL_DIG                              15
     DBL_MIN_EXP                       -1021
     DBL_MIN_10_EXP                     -307
     DBL_MAX_EXP                        1024
     DBL_MAX_10_EXP                      308
     DBL_MAX         1.7976931348623157E+308
     DBL_MIN         2.2250738585072014E-308
     DBL_EPSILON     2.2204460492503131E-016

A.5.4 Structure Field Offset Measurement
----------------------------------------

You can use `offsetof' to measure the location within a structure type
of a particular structure member.

 -- Macro: size_t offsetof (TYPE, MEMBER)
     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Safe | AC-Safe | *Note POSIX Safety
     Concepts::.

     This expands to an integer constant expression that is the offset
     of the structure member named MEMBER in the structure type TYPE.
     For example, `offsetof (struct s, elem)' is the offset, in bytes,
     of the member `elem' in a `struct s'.

     This macro won't work if MEMBER is a bit field; you get an error
     from the C compiler in that case.
