The output format of

is as follows:
.fam C
.RS
.nf
 1:  # file: somedir/
 2:  user.name0="value0"

Line 1 identifies the file name for which the
following lines are being reported.
The remaining lines (lines 2 to 4 above) show the
.I name
and 
.I value
pairs associated with the specified file.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP 4
.BR \-n " \f2name\f1, " \-\-name "=\f2name\f1"
Dump the value of the named extended attribute extended attribute.
.TP
.BR \-d ", " \-\-dump
Dump the values of all extended attributes associated with
.IR pathname .
.TP
.BR \-e " \f2en\f1, " \-\-encoding "=\f2en\f1"
Encode values after retrieving them.
Valid values of
.I en
are "text", "hex", and "base64".
Values encoded as text strings are enclosed in double quotes ("),
while strings encoded as hexidecimal and base64 are prefixed with
0x and 0s, respectively.
.TP
.BR \-h ", " \-\-no-dereference
Do not dereference symlinks. Instead of the file a symlink refers to, the
symlink itself is examined.  Unless doing a logical (\-L) traversal, do not
traverse symlinks to directories.
.TP
.BR \-m " \f2pattern\f1, " \-\-match "=\f2pattern\f1"
Only include attributes with names matching the regular expression
.IR pattern .
The default value for
.I pattern
is "^user\\\\.", 
which includes all the attributes in the user namespace. Specify "\-" for
including all attributes.  Refer to
.BR attr (5)
for a more detailed discussion of namespaces.
.TP

.TP
.BR \-R ", " \-\-recursive
List the attributes of all files and directories recursively.
.TP
.BR \-L ", " \-\-logical
Logical walk, follow symbolic links to directories.
The default behaviour is to follow symbolic link arguments unless
\-\-no\-dereference is given, and to skip symbolic links encountered in
subdirectories.
Only effective in combination with \-R.
.TP
.BR \-P ", " \-\-physical
Physical walk, do not follow symbolic links to directories.
This also skips symbolic link arguments.
Only effective in combination with \-R.
.TP

Print the version of
.B getfattr
and exit.
