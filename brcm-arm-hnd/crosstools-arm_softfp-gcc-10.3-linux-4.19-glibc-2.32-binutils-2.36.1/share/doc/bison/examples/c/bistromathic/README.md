# bistromathic - all the bells and whistles
This example demonstrates best practices when using Bison.
- Its hand-written scanner tracks locations.
- Its interface is pure.
- It uses %params to pass user information to the parser and scanner.
- Its scanner uses the `error` token to signal lexical errors and enter
  error recovery.
- Its interface is "incremental", well suited for interaction: it uses the
  push-parser API to feed the parser with the incoming tokens.
- It features an interactive command line with completion based on the
  parser state, based on `yyexpected_tokens`.
- It uses Bison's standard catalogue for internationalization of generated
  messages.
- It uses a custom syntax error with location, lookahead correction and
  token internationalization.
- Error messages quote the source with squiggles that underline the error:
```
> 123 456
1.5-7: syntax error: expected end of file or + or - or * or / or ^ before number
    1 | 123 456
      |     ^~~
```
- It supports debug traces with semantic values.
- It uses named references instead of the traditional $1, $2, etc.

To customize the interaction with bistromathic, see the GNU Readline user
manual (see `info rluserman`).
